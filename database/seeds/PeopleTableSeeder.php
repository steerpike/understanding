He was one of the Seven Sages of Greece. Many, most notably Aristotle, regarded him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, and he is otherwise historically recognized as the first individual in Western civilization known to have entertained and engaged in scientific philosophy.</p><p>Thales is recognized for breaking from the use of mythology to explain the world and the universe, and instead explaining natural objects and phenomena by theories and hypotheses, in a precursor to modern science. Almost all the other Pre-Socratic philosophers followed him in explaining nature as deriving from a unity of everything based on the existence of a single ultimate substance, instead of using mythological explanations. Aristotle reported Thales\' hypothesis that the originating principle of nature and the nature of matter was a single material substance: water.
</p><p>In mathematics, Thales used geometry to calculate the heights of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is the first known individual to use deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales\' theorem. He is the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.</p>',

Pherecydes authored a cosmogony,  derived from three divine principles, <i>Zas</i> (Zeus), <i>Cthonie</i> (Earth) and <i>Chronos</i> (Time), known as the "Pentemychos" (Πεντέμυχος, "of the five recesses"; sometimes the alternative title "Heptamychos", "seven recesses" is given). It formed a bridge between the mythological thought of Hesiod and pre-Socratic philosophy. His work is lost, but it survived into the Hellenistic period and we are informed on part of its content indirectly. Pherecydes was said to have been the first writer to communicate philosophical musings in prose. According to William (ca. 1896), <i>Aristotle regarded him partly a mythological writer and Plutarch, as well as many other writers gave him the title of Theologus</i>.</p>',

He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils.</p><p>Little of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies, although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.
</p><p>He was an early proponent of science and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular interest in its origins, claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long. Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander\'s philosophy included contributions to many disciplines. In astronomy, he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or apeiron) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of geometry allowed him to introduce the gnomon in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of geography. He was also involved in the politics of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.

This tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what Anaximenes is principally known for today.

<p><b>Pythagoras of Samos</b> (c.<span> 570</span> – c.<span> 495 BC</span>) was an Ionian Greek philosopher and the eponymous founder of the Pythagoreanism movement. His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and, through them, Western philosophy. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a seal engraver on the island of Samos. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras\'s education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to Croton, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included vegetarianism, although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism.
</p><p>The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is <i>metempsychosis</i>, or the "transmigration of souls", which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body. He may have also devised the doctrine of <i>musica universalis</i>, which holds that the planets move according to mathematical equations and thus resonate to produce an inaudible symphony of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the numerological and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly Philolaus of Croton. Following Croton\'s decisive victory over Sybaris in around 510 BC, Pythagoras\'s followers came into conflict with supporters of democracy and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or escaped to Metapontum, where he eventually died.
</p><p>In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the Pythagorean theorem, Pythagorean tuning, the five regular solids, the Theory of Proportions, the sphericity of the Earth, and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom") and that he was the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or natural philosophy.
</p><p>Pythagoras influenced Plato, whose dialogues, especially his <i>Timaeus</i>, exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted ancient Greek art. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among Middle Platonists, coinciding with the rise of Neopythagoreanism. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the Middle Ages and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern European esotericism and his teachings as portrayed in Ovid\'s <i>Metamorphoses</i> influenced the modern vegetarian movement.

Xenophanes lived a life of travel, having left Ionia at the age of 25 and continuing to travel throughout the Greek world for another 67 years. Some scholars say he lived in exile in Sicily. Knowledge of his views comes from fragments of his poetry, surviving as quotations by later Greek writers. To judge from these, his elegiac and iambic poetry criticized and satirized a wide range of ideas, including Homer and Hesiod, the belief in the pantheon of anthropomorphic gods and the Greeks\' veneration of athleticism. He is the earliest Greek poet who claims explicitly to be writing for future generations, creating "fame that will reach all of Greece, and never die while the Greek kind of songs survives."</p>

Aristotle (<i>Poetics</i> 5.1449b5) writes that he and Phormis invented comic plots (μῦθοι, <i>muthoi</i>). Most of the information about Epicharmus comes from the writings of Athenaeus, <i>Suda</i> and Diogenes Laertius, although fragments and comments come up in a host of other ancient authors as well.  There have also been some papyrus finds of longer sections of text, but these are often so full of holes that it is difficult to make sense of them. Plato mentions Epicharmus in his dialogue <i>Gorgias</i> and in <i>Theaetetus</i>.  In the latter, Socrates refers to Epicharmus as "the prince of Comedy", Homer as "the prince of Tragedy", and both as "great masters of either kind of poetry". More references by ancient authors are discussed in Pickard-Cambridge\'s <i>Dithyramb, Tragedy, Comedy</i> and they are collected in Greek in Kassel and Austin\'s new edition of the fragments in <i>Poetae Comici Graeci</i> (2001).

He was of distinguished parentage. Little is known about his early life and education, but he regarded himself as self-taught and a pioneer of wisdom. From the lonely life he led, and still more from the apparently riddled and allegedly paradoxical nature of his philosophy and his stress upon the heedless unconsciousness of humankind, he was called "The Obscure" and the "Weeping Philosopher".
</p><p>Heraclitus was famous for his insistence on ever-present change as being the fundamental essence of the universe, as stated in the famous saying, "No man ever steps in the same river twice" (see <i>panta rhei</i> below). This is commonly considered to be one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of becoming, and has been contrasted with Parmenides statement that "what-is is" as one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of being. As such, Parmenides and Heraclitus are commonly considered to be two of the founders of ontology. Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, or Heraclitus to Parmenides, though opinion on who was responding to whom changed over the course of the 20th century. Heraclitus\' position was complemented by his stark commitment to a unity of opposites in the world, stating that "the path up and down are one and the same". Through these doctrines Heraclitus characterized all existing entities by pairs of contrary properties, whereby no entity may ever occupy a single state at a single time. This, along with his cryptic utterance that "all entities come to be in accordance with this <i>Logos</i>" (literally, "word", "reason", or "account") has been the subject of numerous interpretations.

He was the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy. The single known work of Parmenides is a poem, <i>On Nature</i>, which has survived only in fragmentary form. In this poem, Parmenides prescribes two views of reality. In "the way of truth" (a part of the poem), he explains how reality (coined as "what is-is") is one, change is impossible, and existence is timeless, uniform, necessary, and unchanging. This is generally considered to be one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of being, and has been contrasted with Heraclitus statement that "No man ever steps in the same river twice" as one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of becoming. As such, Parmenides and Heraclitus are generally considered to be two of the founders of ontology. Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, or Heraclitus to Parmenides, though opinion on who was responding to who changed over the course of the 20th century. In "the way of opinion", Parmenides explains the world of appearances, in which one\'s sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful.

Born in Clazomenae at a time when Asia Minor was under the control of the Persian Empire, Anaxagoras came to Athens. According to Diogenes Laertius and Plutarch, in later life he was charged with impiety and went into exile in Lampsacus; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with Pericles, if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers.</p><p>Responding to the claims of Parmenides on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, "each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it". He introduced the concept of <i>Nous</i> (Cosmic Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was homogeneous, or nearly so.
</p><p>He also gave a number of novel scientific accounts of natural phenomena. He produced a correct explanation for eclipses and described the sun as a fiery mass larger than the Peloponnese, as well as attempting to explain rainbows and meteors.

Empedocles\' philosophy is best known for originating the cosmogenic theory of the four classical elements. He also proposed forces he called Love and Strife which would mix and separate the elements, respectively. These physical speculations were part of a history of the universe which also dealt with the origin and development of life.
</p><p>Influenced by the Pythagoreans, Empedocles was a vegetarian who supported the doctrine of reincarnation. He is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to have recorded his ideas in verse. Some of his work survives, more than is the case for any other pre-Socratic philosopher. Empedocles\' death was mythologized by ancient writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.

In his dialogue, <i>Protagoras</i>, Plato credits him with having invented the role of the professional sophist.
</p><p>He also is believed to have created a major controversy during ancient times through his statement that, "Man is the measure of all things", interpreted by Plato to mean that there is no absolute truth, but that which individuals deem to be the truth. Although there is reason to question the extent of the interpretation of his arguments that has followed, that concept of individual relativity was revolutionary for the time, and contrasted with other philosophical doctrines that claimed the universe was based on something objective, outside human influence or perceptions.

Along with Protagoras, he forms the first generation of Sophists. Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of Empedocles, although he would only have been a few years younger. "Like other Sophists, he was an itinerant that practiced in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to ask miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies." He has been called "Gorgias the Nihilist" although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial.</p><p>His chief claim to recognition is that he transplanted rhetoric from his native Sicily to Attica, and contributed to the diffusion of the Attic dialect as the language of literary prose.

<p><b>Socrates</b> (<span></span>; Ancient Greek: <span lang="grc">Σωκρᾰ́της</span>, <small>translit. </small><i lang="grc-Latn" title="Ancient Greek-language transliteration">Sōkrátēs</i>, <small></small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[sɔːkrátɛːs]</span>; c.<span> 470</span> – 399 BC) was a classical  Greek (Athenian) philosopher credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy, and as being the first moral philosopher, of the Western ethical tradition of thought.
An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the only source to have written during his lifetime.</p><p>Plato\'s dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, though it is unclear the degree to which Socrates himself is "hidden behind his \'best disciple<span>\'</span>". Through his portrayal in Plato\'s dialogues, Socrates has become renowned for his contribution to the fields of ethics and epistemology. It is this <b><span id="Platonic_Socrates">Platonic Socrates</span></b> who lends his name to the concepts of Socratic irony and the Socratic method, or <i>elenchus.</i>
</p><p>
Socrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity and in the modern era. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature and popular culture have made him one of the most widely known figures in the Western philosophical tradition.</p>',

Born in Athens, Critias was the son of Callaeschrus and a first cousin of Plato\'s mother Perictione. He became a leading and violent member of the Thirty Tyrants. He also was an associate of Socrates, a fact that did not endear Socrates to the Athenian public.
</p><p>Critias was noted in his day for his tragedies, elegies and prose works. Some, like Sextus Empiricus, believe that Critias wrote the <i>Sisyphus fragment</i>; others, however, attribute it to Euripides. His only known play is <i>Peirithous,</i> of which only a single 42-line fragment survives (Sextus Empir. p. 403, 1). In addition, eight shorter quotations from unidentified plays have come down to us.

He came to Athens as ambassador from Ceos, and became known as a speaker and a teacher. Plato treats him with greater respect than the other sophists, and in several of the Platonic dialogues Socrates appears as the friend of Prodicus. One writer claims Socrates used his method of instruction. Prodicus made linguistics and ethics prominent in his curriculum. The content of one of his speeches is still known, and concerns a fable in which Heracles has to make a choice between Virtue and Vice. He also interpreted religion through the framework of naturalism.

BCE) is reported in some ancient  sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory. However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed. As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus\'s word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century. Furthermore, in his <i>Corpus Democriteum</i>, Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus. The present consensus among the world\'s historians of philosophy is that this Leucippus is historical. The matter must remain moot unless more information is forthcoming from the record.

<p><b>Democritus</b> (<span></span>; Greek: <span lang="el">Δημόκριτος</span>, <i>Dēmókritos</i>, meaning "chosen of the people"; <span><abbr title="circa">c.</abbr>460 —</span> <span><abbr title="circa">c.</abbr>370 BC</span>) was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher primarily remembered today for his formulation of an atomic theory of the universe.</p><p>Democritus was born in Abdera, Thrace, around 460 BC, although there are disagreements about the exact year. His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from those of his mentor Leucippus, as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the 19th-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however, their ideas rested on very different bases.
Largely ignored in ancient Athens, Democritus is said to have been disliked so much by Plato that the latter wished all of his books burned. He was nevertheless well known to his fellow northern-born philosopher Aristotle.
Many consider Democritus to be the "father of modern science". None of his writings have survived; only fragments are known from his vast body of work.</p>',

As a historian, Xenophon is known for recording the history of his time, the late-5th and early-4th centuries BC, in such works as the <i>Hellenica</i>, which covered the final seven years and the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), thus representing a thematic continuation of Thucydides\' <i>History of the Peloponnesian War</i>. 
</p><p>As one of the Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries), Xenophon also participated in Cyrus the Younger\'s failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes II of Persia and recounted the events in <i>Anabasis</i>, his most notable history. Like Plato (427–347 BC), Xenophon is an authority on Socrates, about whom he wrote several books of dialogues (the <i>Memorabilia</i>) and an <i>Apology of Socrates to the Jury</i>, which recounts the philosopher\'s trial in 399 BC.
</p><p>Despite being born an Athenian citizen, Xenophon was also associated with Sparta, the traditional enemy of Athens. His pro-oligarchic politics, military service under Spartan generals, in the Persian campaign and elsewhere, and his friendship with King Agesilaus II endeared Xenophon to the Spartans. Some of his works have a pro–Spartan bias, especially the royal biography <i>Agesilaus</i> and the <i>Constitution of the Spartans</i>.
</p><p>Xenophon\'s works span several genres and are written in plain-language Attic Greek, for which reason they serve as translation exercises for contemporary students of the Ancient Greek language. In the <i>Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</i>, Diogenes Laërtius observed that, as a writer, Xenophon of Athens was known as the “Attic Muse”, for the sweetness of his diction (2.6).

<p><b>Plato</b> (<span></span>; Greek: <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Πλάτων</span> <i>Plátōn</i>, <small>pronounced </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[plá.tɔːn]</span> in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the development of Western philosophy. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato\'s entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.</p><p>Along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle, Plato laid the foundations of Western philosophy and science. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato." In addition to being a foundational figure for Western science, philosophy, and mathematics, Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality.</p><p>Plato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato appears to have been the founder of Western political philosophy, with his <i>Republic</i>, and <i>Laws</i> among other dialogues, providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political questions from a philosophical perspective. Plato\'s own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been Socrates, Parmenides, Heraclitus and Pythagoras, although few of his predecessors\' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself.</p><p>The <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> describes Plato as "...one of the most dazzling writers in the Western literary tradition and one of the most penetrating, wide-ranging, and influential authors in the history of philosophy. ... He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word “philosopher” should be applied. But he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its scope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his invention. Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy approximate him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who studied with him), Aquinas and Kant would be generally agreed to be of the same rank."</p>',

Speusippus was Plato\'s nephew by his sister Potone.  After Plato\'s death, c.348 BC, Speusippus inherited the Academy, near age 60, and remained its head for the next eight years.  However, following a stroke, he passed the chair to Xenocrates. Although the successor to Plato in the Academy, Speusippus frequently diverged from Plato\'s teachings. He rejected Plato\'s Theory of Forms, and whereas Plato had identified the Good with the ultimate <i>principle</i>, Speusippus maintained that the Good was merely secondary. He also argued that it is impossible to have satisfactory knowledge of any thing without knowing all the differences by which it is separated from everything else.

He was born in Sinope, an Ionian colony on the Black Sea, in 412 or 404 BC and died at Corinth in 323 BC.</p><p>Diogenes was a controversial figure. His father minted coins for a living, and Diogenes was banished from Sinope when he took to debasement of currency. After being exiled, he moved to Athens and criticized many cultural conventions of the city. He modeled himself on the example of Heracles, and believed that virtue was better revealed in action than in theory. He used his simple life-style and behaviour to criticize the social values and institutions of what he saw as a corrupt, confused society. He had a reputation for sleeping and eating wherever he chose in a highly non-traditional fashion, and took to toughening himself against nature. He declared himself a cosmopolitan and a citizen of the world rather than claiming allegiance to just one place. There are many tales about his dogging Antisthenes\' footsteps and becoming his "faithful hound".</p><p>Diogenes made a virtue of poverty. He begged for a living and often slept in a large ceramic jar in the marketplace. He became notorious for his philosophical stunts, such as carrying a lamp during the day, claiming to be looking for an honest man. He criticized Plato, disputed his interpretation of Socrates, and sabotaged his lectures, sometimes distracting attenders by bringing food and eating during the discussions. Diogenes was also noted for having publicly mocked Alexander the Great.</p><p>Diogenes was captured by pirates and sold into slavery, eventually settling in Corinth. There he passed his philosophy of Cynicism to Crates, who taught it to Zeno of Citium, who fashioned it into the school of Stoicism, one of the most enduring schools of Greek philosophy. None of Diogenes\' writings have survived, but there are some details of his life from anecdotes (<i>chreia</i>), especially from Diogenes Laërtius\' book <i>Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</i> and some other sources.</p>',

His teachings followed those of Plato, which he attempted to define more closely, often with mathematical elements. He distinguished three forms of being: the sensible, the intelligible, and a third compounded of the two, to which correspond respectively, sense, intellect and opinion. He considered unity and duality to be gods which rule the universe, and the soul a self-moving number. God pervades all things, and there are daemonical powers, intermediate between the divine and the mortal, which consist in conditions of the soul. He held that mathematical objects and the Platonic Ideas are identical, unlike Plato who distinguished them. In ethics, he taught that virtue produces happiness, but external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect its purpose.

</p>
<p><b>Aristotle</b> (<span></span>; Greek: <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Ἀριστοτέλης</span> <i>Aristotélēs</i>, <small>pronounced </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[aristotélɛːs]</span>; 384–322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidiki, in the north of Classical Greece. Along with Plato, he is considered the "Father of Western Philosophy". Aristotle provided a complex and harmonious synthesis of the various existing philosophies prior to him, including those of Socrates and Plato, and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its fundamental intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be central to the contemporary philosophical discussion.
</p><p>Little is known for certain about his life. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato\'s Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. Teaching Alexander gave Aristotle many opportunities. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books, which were papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato\'s death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism. He believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on perception. Aristotle\'s views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.
</p><p>Aristotle\'s views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics. Some of Aristotle\'s zoological observations, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan. Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Islamic thought during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.
</p><p>All aspects of Aristotle\'s philosophy continue to be the object of academic study. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including Raphael and Rembrandt. Early Modern theories including William Harvey\'s circulation of the blood and Galileo Galilei\'s kinematics were developed in reaction to Aristotle\'s. In the 19th century, George Boole gave Aristotle\'s logic a mathematical foundation with his system of algebraic logic. In the 20th century, Martin Heidegger created a new interpretation of Aristotle\'s political philosophy, but elsewhere Aristotle was widely criticised, even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the biologist Peter Medawar.  More recently, Aristotle has again been taken seriously, such as in the thinking of Ayn Rand and Alasdair MacIntyre, while Armand Marie Leroi has reconstructed Aristotle\'s biology. The image of Aristotle tutoring the young Alexander remains current, and the <i>Poetics</i> continues to play a role in the cinema of the United States.

<p><b>Theophrastus</b> (<span></span>; Greek: <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Θεόφραστος</span> <i>Theόphrastos</i>; c. 371 – c. 287 BC), a Greek native of Eresos in Lesbos, was the successor to Aristotle in the Peripatetic school. He came to Athens at a young age and initially studied in Plato\'s school. After Plato\'s death, he attached himself to Aristotle who took to Theophrastus his writings. When Aristotle fled Athens, Theophrastus took over as head of the Lyceum. Theophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school flourished greatly. He is often considered the <i>father of botany</i> for his works on plants. After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral. His successor as head of the school was Strato of Lampsacus.
</p><p>The interests of Theophrastus were wide ranging, extending from biology and physics to ethics and metaphysics. His two surviving botanical works, <i>Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum)</i>  and <i>On the Causes of Plants</i>, were an important influence on Renaissance science. There are also surviving works <i>On Moral Characters</i>, <i> On Sense Perception</i>, <i>On Stones</i>, and fragments on <i>Physics</i> and <i>Metaphysics</i>. In philosophy, he studied grammar and language and continued Aristotle\'s work on logic. He also regarded space as the mere arrangement and position of bodies, time as an accident of motion, and motion as a necessary consequence of all activity. In ethics, he regarded happiness as depending on external influences as well as on virtue.

He devoted himself especially to the study of natural science, and increased the naturalistic elements in Aristotle\'s thought to such an extent, that he denied the need for an active god to construct the universe, preferring to place the government of the universe in the unconscious force of nature alone.

            'description' => '<p><b>Epicurus</b> (341–270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher who founded a highly influential school of philosophy now called Epicureanism. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristotle, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as "the Garden," in Athens. He and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects, and he openly allowed women to join the school as a matter of policy. An extremely prolific writer, he is said to have originally written over 300 works on various subjects, but the vast majority of these writings have been lost. Only three letters written by him—the <i>Letters to Menoeceus</i>, <i>Pythocles</i>, and <i>Herodotus</i>—and two collections of quotes—the <i>Principle Doctrines</i> and the <i>Vatican Sayings</i>—have survived intact, along with a few fragments and quotations of his other writings. His teachings are better recorded in the writings of later authors, including the Roman poet Lucretius, the philosopher Philodemus, the philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the biographer Diogenes Laërtius. 
</p><p>For Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by <i>ataraxia</i>—peace and freedom from fear—and <i>aponia</i>—the absence of pain—and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neurosis is death denial, and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Likewise, Epicurus taught that the gods, though they do exist, have no involvement in human affairs and do not punish or reward people for their actions. Nonetheless, he maintained that people should still behave ethically because amoral behavior will burden them with guilt and prevent them from attaining <i>ataraxia</i>.
</p><p>Like Aristotle, Epicurus was an empiricist, meaning he believed that the senses are the only reliable source of knowledge about the world. He derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus (<abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 460—<abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 370 BC). Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as <i>atoms</i>. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus in his teaching of atomic "swerve", which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.
</p><p>Though popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic, before declining as the rival school of Stoicism grew in popularity at its expense. It finally died out in late antiquity in the wake of early Christianity. Epicurus himself was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered throughout the Middle Ages as a patron of drunkards, whoremongers, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre Gassendi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx.

Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature. It proved very popular, and flourished as one of the major schools of philosophy from the Hellenistic period through to the Roman era.

He was born in Phlius, moved to Megara, and then he returned home and married. He next went to Elis with his wife, and heard Pyrrho, whose tenets he adopted. He also lived on the Hellespont, and taught at Chalcedon, before moving to Athens, where he lived until his death. His writings were said to have been very numerous. He composed poetry, tragedies, satiric dramas, and comedies, of which very little remains. His most famous composition was his <i>Silloi</i>, a satirical account of famous philosophers, living and dead, in hexameter verse. The <i>Silloi</i> has not survived intact, but it is mentioned and quoted by several ancient authors.

He was a native of Soli, Cilicia, but moved to Athens as a young man, where he became a pupil of Cleanthes in the Stoic school. When Cleanthes died, around 230 BC, Chrysippus became the third head of the school. A prolific writer, Chrysippus expanded the fundamental doctrines of Zeno of Citium, the founder of the school, which earned him the title of Second Founder of Stoicism.</p><p>Chrysippus excelled in logic, the theory of knowledge, ethics, and physics. He created an original system of propositional logic in order to better understand the workings of the universe and role of humanity within it. He adhered to a deterministic view of fate, but nevertheless sought a role for personal freedom in thought and action. Ethics, he thought, depended on understanding the nature of the universe, and he taught a therapy of extirpating the unruly passions which depress and crush the soul. He initiated the success of Stoicism as one of the most influential philosophical movements for centuries in the Greek and Roman world.

By the year 159 BC, he had started to refute all previous dogmatic doctrines, especially Stoicism, and even the Epicureans whom previous skeptics had spared. As head of the Academy, he was one of three philosophers sent to Rome in 155 BC where his lectures on the uncertainty of justice caused consternation among leading politicians. He left no writings and many of his opinions are known only via his successor Clitomachus. He seems to have doubted the ability, not just of the senses but of reason too, in acquiring truth. His skepticism was, however, moderated by the belief that we can, nevertheless, ascertain probabilities of truth, to enable us to live and act correctly.

His only known work is the philosophical poem <i>De rerum natura</i>, a didactic work about the tenets and philosophy of Epicureanism, and which is usually translated into English as <i>On the Nature of Things</i>. Lucretius has been credited with originating the concept of the three-age system which was formalised from 1834 by C. J. Thomsen.
</p><p>Very little is known about Lucretius\'s life; the only certain fact is that he was either a friend or client of Gaius Memmius, to whom the poem was addressed and dedicated.</p><p><i>De rerum natura</i> was a considerable influence on the Augustan poets, particularly Virgil (in his <i>Aeneid</i> and <i>Georgics</i>, and to a lesser extent on the <i>Eclogues</i>) and Horace. The work virtually disappeared during the Middle Ages, but was rediscovered in 1417 in a monastery in Germany by Poggio Bracciolini and it played an important role both in the development of atomism (Lucretius was an important influence on Pierre Gassendi) and the efforts of various figures of the Enlightenment era to construct a new Christian humanism.

<p><b>Marcus Tullius Cicero</b> (<span></span>; <small>Classical Latin: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈmaːr.kʊs ˈtʊl.lɪ.ʊs ˈkɪ.kɛ.roː]</span>; 3 January 106 BC – 7 December 43 BC) was a Roman statesman, orator, lawyer and philosopher, who served as consul in the year 63 BC. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome\'s greatest orators and prose stylists.</p><p>His influence on the Latin language was so immense that the subsequent history of prose, not only in Latin but in European languages up to the 19th century, was said to be either a reaction against or a return to his style. According to Michael Grant, "the influence of Cicero upon the history of European literature and ideas greatly exceeds that of any other prose writer in any language". Cicero introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary (with neologisms such as <i>evidentia</i>, <i>humanitas</i>, <i>qualitas</i>, <i>quantitas</i>, and <i>essentia</i>) distinguishing himself as a translator and philosopher.
</p><p>Though he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement. It was during his consulship that the second Catilinarian conspiracy attempted to overthrow the government through an attack on the city by outside forces, and Cicero suppressed the revolt by summarily and controversially executing five conspirators. During the chaotic latter half of the 1st century BC marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Gaius Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. Following Julius Caesar\'s death, Cicero became an enemy of Mark Antony in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a series of speeches. He was proscribed as an enemy of the state by the Second Triumvirate and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43 BC after having been intercepted during an attempted flight from the Italian peninsula. His severed hands and head were then, as a final revenge of Mark Antony, displayed in the Roman Forum.
</p><p>Petrarch\'s rediscovery of Cicero\'s letters is often credited for initiating the 14th-century Renaissance in public affairs, humanism, and classical Roman culture. According to Polish historian Tadeusz Zieliński, "the Renaissance was above all things a revival of Cicero, and only after him and through him of the rest of Classical antiquity." The peak of Cicero\'s authority and prestige came during the 18th-century Enlightenment, and his impact on leading Enlightenment thinkers and political theorists such as John Locke, David Hume, Montesquieu and Edmund Burke was substantial.
His works rank among the most influential in European culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history, especially the last days of the Roman Republic.</p>',

</p><p>Philo used philosophical allegory to harmonize Jewish scripture, mainly the Torah, with Greek philosophy. His method followed the practices of both Jewish exegesis and Stoic philosophy. His allegorical exegesis was important for some Christian Church Fathers, but he had very little reception history within the Rabbinic Judaism. He adopted allegorical instead of literal interpretations of the Hebrew Bible.
</p><p>Some scholars hold that his concept of the Logos as God\'s creative principle influenced early Christology. Other scholars deny direct influence but say that Philo and Early Christianity borrow from a common source.</p><p>The only event in Philo\'s life that can be decisively dated is his participation in the embassy to Rome in 40 CE. He represented the Alexandrian Jews in a delegation to the Roman Emperor Gaius (Caligula) following civil strife between the Alexandrian Jewish and Greek communities. The story of this event, and a few other biographical details, are found in Josephus and in Philo\'s own works, especially in <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">Legatio ad Gaium</i> (<i>Embassy to Gaius</i>) of which only two of the original five volumes survive..
</p><p>The thought of Philo was largely inspired by Aristobulus of Paneas and the Alexandrian School, concerning his work "Wisdom of Solomon" and the occupations of the Therapeutæ and the Essenes. Philo has never been claimed as a saint nor Doctor of the Church.

</p><p>Seneca was born in Cordoba in Hispania, and raised in Rome, where he was trained in rhetoric and philosophy. He was a tutor and later advisor to emperor Nero.  He was forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero, in which he was likely to have been innocent. His father was Seneca the Elder, his elder brother was Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, and his nephew was the poet Lucan. His stoic and calm suicide has become the subject of numerous paintings. As a writer Seneca is known for his philosophical works, and for his plays which are all tragedies. His philosophical writings include a dozen philosophical essays, and one hundred and twenty-four letters dealing with moral issues. As a tragedian, he is best known for his <i>Medea</i> and <i>Thyestes</i>.

To Epictetus, all external events are  beyond our control; we should accept calmly and dispassionately whatever happens.

</p>
<p><b>Marcus Aurelius</b> (<span></span>; Latin: <i lang="la">Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus</i>; 26 April 121 – 17 March 180 AD), called <b>the Philosopher</b>, was Roman emperor from <span>161 to 180</span>. He ruled with his adoptive brother, Lucius Verus, until Verus\' death in 169, and with his son, Commodus, from 177. He was the last of the rulers traditionally known as the Five Good Emperors.
</p><p>He was a practitioner of Stoicism. His personal philosophical writings, which later came to be called <i>Meditations</i>, are a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. They have been seen as one of the greatest works of philosophy.
</p><p>During his reign, the Roman Empire defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in the East; Marcus Aurelius\' general Avidius Cassius sacked the Parthian capital Ctesiphon in 164. In central Europe, Marcus Aurelius fought the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatians with success during the Marcomannic Wars, although the threat of the Germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. Persecution of Christians is said to have increased during his reign.
</p><p>His death in 180 is seen as an end to the Pax Romana. The increasing instability in the West that followed has traditionally been seen as the beginning of the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire.

</p><p>In his medical work, as reflected by his name, tradition maintains that he belonged to the empiric school in which Pyrrhonism was popular.

In his philosophy, described in the <i>Enneads</i>, there are three principles: the One, the Intellect, and the Soul. His teacher was Ammonius Saccas and he is of the Platonic tradition.  Historians of the 19th century invented the term Neoplatonism and applied it to him and his philosophy which was influential in Late Antiquity. Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from Porphyry\'s preface to his edition of Plotinus\' <i>Enneads</i>. His metaphysical writings have inspired centuries of Pagan, Islamic, Jewish, Christian,  and Gnostic metaphysicians and mystics.

<p><b>Saint Augustine of Hippo</b> (<span></span>; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430 AD) was a  Roman African, early Christian theologian and philosopher from Numidia whose writings influenced the development of Western Christianity and Western philosophy. He was the bishop of Hippo Regius in north Africa and is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers in Western Christianity for his writings in the Patristic Period. Among his most important works are <i>The City of God</i>, <i>On Christian Doctrine</i> and <i>Confessions.</i>
</p><p>According to his contemporary Jerome, Augustine "established anew the ancient Faith". In his youth he was drawn to Manichaeism and later to neo-Platonism. After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 386, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives. Believing that the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of original sin and made seminal contributions to the development of just war theory. When the Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate, Augustine imagined the Church as a spiritual City of God, distinct from the material Earthly City. His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. The segment of the Church that adhered to the concept of the Trinity as defined by the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople closely identified with Augustine\'s <i>On the Trinity</i>.
</p><p>Augustine is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Christian Church, and the Anglican Communion and as a preeminent Doctor of the Church. He is also the patron of the Augustinians. His memorial is celebrated on 28 August, the day of his death. Augustine is the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, the alleviation of sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses. Many Protestants, especially Calvinists and Lutherans, consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the Protestant Reformation due to his teachings on salvation and divine grace. Protestant Reformers generally, and Martin Luther in particular, held Augustine in preeminence among early Church Fathers. Luther himself was, from 1505 to 1521, a member of the Order of the Augustinian Eremites.
</p><p>In the East, his teachings are more disputed, and were notably attacked by John Romanides. But other theologians and figures of the Eastern Orthodox Church have shown significant appropriation of his writings, chiefly Georges Florovsky. The most controversial doctrine associated with him, the filioque, was rejected by the Orthodox Church. Other disputed teachings include his views on original sin, the doctrine of grace, and predestination. Nevertheless, though considered to be mistaken on some points, he is still considered a saint, and has even had influence on some Eastern Church Fathers, most notably Saint Gregory Palamas. In the Orthodox Church his feast day is celebrated on 15 June. Historian Diarmaid MacCulloch has written: "[Augustine\'s] impact on Western Christian thought can hardly be overstated; only his beloved example Paul of Tarsus, has been more influential, and Westerners have generally seen Paul through Augustine\'s eyes."</p>

He was born about a year after Odoacer deposed the last Roman Emperor and declared himself King of Italy, and entered public service under Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great, who later imprisoned and executed him in 524 on charges of conspiracy to overthrow him.  While jailed, Boethius composed his <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>, a philosophical treatise on fortune, death, and other issues, which became one of the most popular and influential works of the Middle Ages. As the author of numerous handbooks and translator of Aristotle, he became the main intermediary between the Antiquity and following centuries.

A rigorous, sometimes polemical writer and an original thinker who was controversial in his own time, John Philoponus broke from the Aristotelian–Neoplatonic tradition, questioning methodology and eventually leading to empiricism in the natural sciences. He was one of the first to propose a "theory of impetus" similar to the modern concept of inertia over Aristotelian dynamics.
</p><p>Later in life Philoponus turned to Christian apologetics, arguing against the eternity of the world, a theory which formed the basis of pagan attacks on the Christian doctrine of Creation. He also wrote on Christology and was posthumously condemned as a heretic by the Imperial Church in 680–81 because of what was perceived as a tritheistic interpretation of the Trinity.
</p><p>His by-name <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">ὁ Φιλόπονος</span> translates as "lover of toil", i.e. "diligent," referring to a miaphysite confraternity in Alexandria, the <i>philoponoi,</i> who were active in debating pagan (i.e. Neoplatonic) philosophers.
</p><p>His posthumous condemnation limited the spread of his writing, but copies of his work did circulate in Greek or Latin versions in medieval Europe, influencing Bonaventure and Buridan. His work was also received in Arabic scholarly tradition, where he is known as <i lang="ar-Latn" title="Arabic language text">Yaḥyā al-Naḥwī</i> (i.e. "John the Grammarian"). His critique of Aristotle in the <i>Physics</i> commentary was a major influence on Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Galileo Galilei, who cited Philoponus substantially in his works.</p>',

<p><b>Abu Yūsuf Yaʻqūb ibn ʼIsḥāq aṣ-Ṣabbāḥ al-Kindī</b> (<span></span>; Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">أبو يوسف يعقوب بن إسحاق الصبّاح الكندي</span>‎; Latin: <i lang="la">Alkindus</i>; c. 801–873 AD) was an Arab Muslim philosopher, polymath, mathematician, physician and musician. Al-Kindi was the first of the Muslim peripatetic philosophers, and is unanimously hailed as the "father of Arab philosophy" for his synthesis, adaptation and promotion of Greek and Hellenistic philosophy in the Muslim world.</p><p>Al-Kindi was born  in Kufa and educated in Baghdad. He became a prominent figure in the House of Wisdom, and a number of Abbasid Caliphs appointed him to oversee the translation of Greek scientific and philosophical texts into the Arabic language. This contact with "the philosophy of the ancients" (as Greek philosophy was often referred to by Muslim scholars) had a profound effect on his intellectual development, and led him to write hundreds of original treatises of his own on a range of subjects ranging from metaphysics, ethics, logic and psychology, to medicine, pharmacology, mathematics, astronomy, astrology and optics, and further afield to more practical topics like perfumes, swords, jewels, glass, dyes, zoology, tides, mirrors, meteorology and earthquakes.</p><p>In the field of mathematics, al-Kindi played an important role in introducing Indian numerals to the Islamic and Christian world. Al-Kindi was also one of the fathers of cryptography. His book entitled <i>Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages</i> gave rise to the birth of cryptanalysis and devised several new methods of breaking ciphers. Using his mathematical and medical expertise, he was able to develop a scale that would allow doctors to quantify the potency of their medication.</p><p>The central theme underpinning al-Kindi\'s philosophical writings is the compatibility between philosophy and other "orthodox" Islamic sciences, particularly theology. And many of his works deal with subjects that theology had an immediate interest in. These include the nature of God, the soul and prophetic knowledge. But despite the important role he played in making philosophy accessible to Muslim intellectuals, his own philosophical output was largely overshadowed by that of al-Farabi and very few of his texts are available for modern scholars to examine.

<p><b>John Scotus Eriugena</b> or <b>Johannes Scotus Erigena</b> (<span></span>; c. 815 – c. 877) was an Irish theologian, neoplatonist philosopher, and poet. He wrote a number of works, but is best known today for having written <i>The Division of Nature</i>, which has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which "synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries." 
</p><p>Eriugena argued on behalf of something like a pantheistic definition of nature. He translated and made commentaries upon the work of Pseudo-Dionysius, and was one of the few Western European philosophers of his day that knew Greek, having studied in Athens. Famously, he is said to have been stabbed to death by his students at Malmesbury with their pens.

He also wrote on logic, astronomy and grammar.</p><p>A comprehensive thinker, Razi made fundamental and enduring contributions to various fields, which he recorded in over 200 manuscripts, and is particularly remembered for numerous advances in medicine through his observations and discoveries. An early proponent of experimental medicine, he became a successful doctor, and served as chief physician of Baghdad and Ray hospitals. As a teacher of medicine, he attracted students of all backgrounds and interests and was said to be compassionate and devoted to the service of his patients, whether rich or poor.</p><p>According to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> (1911), he was among the first to use humoral theory to distinguish one contagious disease from another, and wrote a pioneering book about smallpox and measles providing clinical characterization of the diseases. He also discovered numerous compounds and chemicals including alcohol and sulfuric acid, among others.</p><p>Through translation, his medical works and ideas became known among medieval European practitioners and profoundly influenced medical education in the Latin West. Some volumes of his work <i>Al-Mansuri</i>, namely "On Surgery" and "A General Book on Therapy", became part of the medical curriculum in Western universities. Edward Granville Browne considers him as "probably the greatest and most original of all the Muslim physicians, and one of the most prolific as an author". Additionally, he has been described as a doctor\'s doctor, the father of pediatrics, and a pioneer of ophthalmology. For example, he was the first to recognize the reaction of the eye\'s pupil to light.</p>

He published over a hundred poems, as well as works of biblical exegesis, philosophy, ethics and satire. One source credits ibn Gabirol with creating a golem, possibly female, for household chores.</p><p>In the 19th century it was discovered that medieval translators had Latinized Gabirol\'s name to <b>Avicebron</b> or <b>Avencebrol</b> and had translated his work on Jewish Neo-Platonic philosophy into a Latin form that had in the intervening centuries been highly regarded as a work of Islamic or Christian scholarship. As such, ibn Gabirol is well known in the history of philosophy for the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form (“Universal Hylomorphism”), and for his emphasis on divine will.</p>',

After his death, he was canonized as a saint; his feast day is 21 April.
</p><p>Beginning at Bec, Anselm composed dialogues and treatises with a rational and philosophical approach, sometimes causing him to be credited as the founder of Scholasticism. Despite his lack of recognition in this field in his own time, Anselm is now famed as the originator of the ontological argument for the existence of God and of the satisfaction theory of atonement. He was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by a bull of Pope Clement XI in 1720.
</p><p>As archbishop, he defended the church\'s interests in England amid the Investiture Controversy. For his resistance to the English kings William II and Henry I, he was exiled twice: once from 1097 to 1100 and then from 1105 to 1107. While in exile, he helped guide the Greek bishops of southern Italy to adopt Roman rites at the Council of Bari. He worked for the primacy of Canterbury over the bishops of York and Wales but, though at his death he appeared to have been successful, Pope Paschal II later reversed himself and restored York\'s independence.

He was of Persian origin.</p><p>Islamic tradition considers him to be a Mujaddid, a renewer of the faith who, according to the prophetic hadith, appears once every century to restore the faith of the ummah ("the Islamic Community"). His works were so highly acclaimed by his contemporaries that al-Ghazali was awarded the honorific title "Proof of Islam" (<i>Hujjat al-Islam</i>).</p><p>Al-Ghazali believed that the Islamic spiritual tradition had become moribund and that the spiritual sciences taught by the first generation of Muslims had been forgotten. That resulted in his writing his magnum opus entitled <i>Ihya \'ulum al-din</i> ("The Revival of the Religious Sciences"). Among his other works, the <i>Tahāfut al-Falāsifa</i> ("Incoherence of the Philosophers") is a significant landmark in the history of philosophy, as it advances the critique of Aristotelian science developed later in 14th-century Europe.</p>',

</p>

<p><b>Ibn Rushd</b> (Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl"><span>ابن رشد</span></span>‎; full name Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">أبو الوليد محمد ابن احمد ابن رشد</span>‎, <small>translit. </small><i lang="ar-Latn" title="Arabic-language transliteration">ʾAbū l-Walīd Muḥammad Ibn ʾAḥmad Ibn Rushd</i>; 1126 – 11 December 1198), often Latinized as <b>Averroes</b> (<span></span>), was an Andalusian philosopher and thinker who wrote about many subjects, including philosophy, theology, medicine, astronomy, physics, Islamic jurisprudence and law, and linguistics. His philosophical works include numerous commentaries on Aristotle, for which he was known in the West as <i>The Commentator</i>. He also served as a judge and a court physician for the Almohad caliphate.
</p><p>He was born in Córdoba in 1126 to a family of prominent judges—his grandfather was the celebrated chief judge of the city. In 1169 he was introduced to the caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who was impressed with his knowledge, became his patron and commissioned many of Averroes\' commentaries. Averroes later served multiple terms as a judge in Seville and Córdoba. In 1182, he was appointed as court physician and the chief judge of Córdoba. After Abu Yusuf\'s death in 1184, he remained in royal favor until he fell into disgrace in 1195. He was targeted on various charges—likely for political reasons—and was exiled to nearby Lucena. He returned to royal favor shortly before his death on 11 December 1198.
</p><p>Averroes was a strong proponent of Aristotelianism; he attempted to restore what he considered the original teachings of Aristotle and opposed the Neoplatonist tendencies of earlier Muslim thinkers, such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna. He also defended the pursuit of philosophy against criticism by Ashari theologians such as Al-Ghazali. Averroes argued that philosophy was permissible in Islam and even compulsory among certain elites. He also argued scriptural text should be interpreted allegorically if it appeared to contradict conclusions reached by reason and philosophy. His legacy in the Islamic world was modest for geographical and intellectual reasons.
</p><p>In the West, Averroes was known for his extensive commentaries on Aristotle, many of which were translated into Latin and Hebrew. The translations of his work reawakened Western European interest in Aristotle and Greek thinkers, an area of study that had been widely abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire. His thoughts generated controversies in Latin Christendom and triggered a philosophical movement called Averroism based on his writings. His unity of the intellect thesis, proposing that all humans share the same intellect, became one of the most well-known and controversial Averroist doctrines in the West.  His works were condemned by the Catholic Church in 1270 and 1277. Although weakened by the condemnations and sustained critique by Thomas Aquinas, Latin Averroism continued to attract followers up to the sixteenth century.

In his time, he was also a preeminent astronomer and physician. Born in Córdoba, Almoravid Empire (present-day Spain) on Passover Eve, 1135 or 1138, he worked as a rabbi, physician, and philosopher in Morocco and Egypt. He died in Egypt on December 12, 1204, whence his body was taken to the lower Galilee and buried in Tiberias.</p><p>During his lifetime, most Jews greeted Maimonides\' writings on Jewish law and ethics with acclaim and gratitude, even as far away as Iraq and Yemen. Yet, while Maimonides rose to become the revered head of the Jewish community in Egypt, his writings also had vociferous critics, particularly in Spain. Nonetheless, he was posthumously acknowledged as among the foremost rabbinical arbiters and philosophers in Jewish history, and his copious work comprises a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. His fourteen-volume <i>Mishneh Torah</i> still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of Talmudic law. He is sometimes known as "ha Nesher ha Gadol" (the great eagle) in recognition of his outstanding status as a <i>bona fide</i> exponent of the Oral Torah.
</p><p>Aside from being revered by Jewish historians, Maimonides also figures very prominently in the history of Islamic and Arab sciences and is mentioned extensively in studies. Influenced by Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and his contemporary Averroes, he in his turn influenced other prominent Arab and Muslim philosophers and scientists. He became a prominent philosopher and polymath in both the Jewish and Islamic worlds.

He founded the men\'s Order of Friars Minor, the women’s Order of Saint Clare, the Third Order of Saint Francis and the Custody of the Holy Land. Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in history.</p><p>Pope Gregory IX canonized Francis on 16 July 1228. Along with Saint Catherine of Siena, he was designated Patron saint of Italy. He later became associated with patronage of animals and the natural environment, and it became customary for Catholic and Anglican churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on his feast day of 4 October. He is often remembered as the patron saint of animals. In 1219, he went to Egypt in an attempt to convert the Sultan to put an end to the conflict of the Crusades. By this point, the Franciscan Order had grown to such an extent that its primitive organizational structure was no longer sufficient. He returned to Italy to organize the Order. Once his community was authorized by the Pope, he withdrew increasingly from external affairs. Francis is also known for his love of the Eucharist. In 1223, Francis arranged for the first Christmas live nativity scene. According to Christian tradition, in 1224 he received the stigmata during the apparition of Seraphic angels in a religious ecstasy, which would make him the first person in Christian tradition to bear the wounds of Christ\'s Passion. He died during the evening hours of 3 October 1226, while listening to a reading he had requested of Psalm 142 (141).

<p><b>Roger Bacon</b>  (<span></span>; Latin: <i lang="la">Rogerus</i> or <i><i lang="la" title="Latin language text">Rogerius Baconus, Baconis</i></i>, also <i><i lang="la">Frater</i> Rogerus</i>; c.<span> 1219/20</span> – c.<span> 1292</span>), also known by the scholastic accolade <i><b>Doctor <i lang="la">Mirabilis</i></b></i>, was an English philosopher and Franciscan friar who placed considerable emphasis on the study of nature through empiricism. In the early modern era, he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his mechanical or necromantic brazen head. He is sometimes credited (mainly since the 19th century) as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method inspired by Aristotle and by the Arab scientist Alhazen.</p><p>His linguistic work has been heralded for its early exposition of a universal grammar. However, more recent re-evaluations emphasise that Bacon was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his "experimental" knowledge obtained from books in the scholastic tradition. He was, however, partially responsible for a revision of the medieval university curriculum, which saw the addition of optics to the traditional <i><i lang="la" title="Latin language text">quadrivium</i></i>. A survey of how Bacon\'s work was received over the centuries found that it often reflected the concerns and controversies that were central to his readers.</p><p>Bacon\'s major work, the <i>Opus Majus</i>, was sent to Pope Clement IV in Rome in 1267 upon the pope\'s request. Although gunpowder was first invented and described in China, Bacon was the first in Europe to record its formula.

</p>
<p><b>Saint Thomas Aquinas</b>  (<span></span>; Italian: <i lang="it">Tommaso d\'Aquino</i>, lit. "Thomas of Aquino"; 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian Dominican friar, Catholic priest, and Doctor of the Church. He was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as the <i><b>Doctor Angelicus</b></i> and the <i><b>Doctor Communis</b></i>. The name <i>Aquinas</i> identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio.
</p><p>He was the foremost classical proponent of natural theology and the father of Thomism; of which he argued that reason is found in God. His influence on Western thought is considerable, and much of modern philosophy developed or opposed his ideas, particularly in the areas of ethics, natural law, metaphysics, and political theory. Unlike many currents in the Church of the time, Thomas embraced several ideas put forward by Aristotle—whom he called "the Philosopher"—and attempted to synthesize Aristotelian philosophy with the principles of Christianity. His best-known works are the <i>Disputed Questions on Truth</i> (1256-59), the <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> (1259-1265), and the <i>Summa Theologiae</i> (1265-1274). His commentaries on Scripture and on Aristotle also form an important part of his body of work. Furthermore, Thomas is distinguished for his eucharistic hymns, which form a part of the Church\'s liturgy.</p><p>The Catholic Church honors Thomas Aquinas as a saint and regards him as the model teacher for those studying for the priesthood, and indeed the highest expression of both natural reason and speculative theology. In modern times, under papal directives, the study of his works was long used as a core of the required program of study for those seeking ordination as priests or deacons, as well as for those in religious formation and for other students of the sacred disciplines (philosophy, Catholic theology, church history, liturgy, and canon law).</p><p>Thomas Aquinas is considered one of the Catholic Church\'s greatest theologians and philosophers. Pope Benedict XV declared: "This (Dominican) Order ... acquired new luster when the Church declared the teaching of Thomas to be her own and that Doctor, honored with the special praises of the Pontiffs, the master and patron of Catholic schools." The English philosopher Anthony Kenny considers Thomas to be "one of the dozen greatest philosophers of the western world".</p>

<p><b>John Duns</b>, commonly called <b>Duns Scotus</b> (<span></span>; <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1266 – 8 November 1308), is generally considered to be one of the three most important philosopher-theologians of the High Middle Ages (together with Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham). Scotus has had considerable influence on both Catholic and secular thought. The doctrines for which he is best known are the "univocity of being", that existence is the most abstract concept we have, applicable to everything that exists; the formal distinction, a way of distinguishing between different aspects of the same thing; and the idea of haecceity, the property supposed to be in each individual thing that makes it an individual. Scotus also developed a complex argument for the existence of God, and argued for the Immaculate Conception of Mary.
</p><p>Duns Scotus was given the scholastic accolade <i>Doctor Subtilis</i> (<i>Subtle Doctor</i>) for his penetrating and subtle manner of thought. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993.

He was also an important 14th-century political figure. His political treatise <i>Defensor pacis</i> (The Defender of Peace), an attempt to refute papalist claims to a "plenitude of power" in affairs of both church and state, is seen by some authorities as the most revolutionary political treatise written in the later Middle Ages. It is one of the first examples of a reasoned defense of caesaropapism in Western Europe.</p>',

</p>
<p><b>John Wycliffe</b> (<span></span>; also spelled <i>Wyclif</i>, <i>Wycliff</i>, <i>Wiclef</i>, <i>Wicliffe</i>, <i>Wickliffe</i>; 1320s – 31 December 1384) was an English scholastic philosopher, theologian, Biblical translator, reformer, English priest, and a seminary professor at the University of Oxford. He was an influential dissident within the Roman Catholic priesthood during the 14th century and is considered an important predecessor to Protestantism.
</p><p>Wycliffe attacked the privileged status of the clergy, which was central to their powerful role in England. He then attacked the luxury and pomp of local parishes and their ceremonies.</p><p>Wycliffe was also an advocate for translation of the Bible into the vernacular. He completed a translation directly from the Vulgate into Middle English in the year 1382, now known as Wycliffe\'s Bible. It is probable that he personally translated the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and it is possible he translated the entire New Testament, while his associates translated the Old Testament. Wycliffe\'s Bible appears to have been completed by 1384, additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe\'s assistant John Purvey and others in 1388 and 1395.
</p><p>Wycliffe\'s followers were known as Lollards and followed his lead in advocating predestination, iconoclasm, and the notion of caesaropapism, while attacking the veneration of saints, the sacraments, requiem masses, transubstantiation, monasticism, and the very existence of the Papacy.
</p><p>Beginning in the 16th century, the Lollard movement was regarded as the precursor to the Protestant Reformation. Wycliffe was accordingly characterised as the evening star of scholasticism and the morning star of the English Reformation. Wycliffe\'s writings in Latin greatly influenced the philosophy and teaching of Czech reformer Jan Hus, whose execution in 1415 sparked a revolt and led to the Hussite Wars.</p>

He was a chief pioneer of the revival of Greek scholarship in Western Europe. As revealed in his last literary work, the <i>Nomoi</i> or <i>Book of Laws</i>, which he only circulated among close friends, he rejected Christianity in favour of a return to ancient wisdom based on Zoroaster and the <i>Magi</i>.</p><p>He re-introduced Plato\'s ideas to Western Europe during the 1438–1439 Council of Florence, a failed attempt to reconcile the East-West schism. Here, it was believed until recently, Plethon met and influenced Cosimo de\' Medici to found a new Platonic Academy, which, under Marsilio Ficino, would proceed to translate into Latin all Plato\'s works, the <i>Enneads</i> of Plotinus, and various other Neoplatonist works.

He was an astrologer, a reviver of Neoplatonism in touch with the major academics of his day and the first translator of Plato\'s complete extant works into Latin.  His Florentine Academy, an attempt to revive Plato\'s Academy, influenced the direction and tenor of the Italian Renaissance and the development of European philosophy.

He is famed for the events of 1486, when, at the age of 23, he proposed to defend 900 theses on religion, philosophy, natural philosophy, and magic against all comers, for which he wrote the <i>Oration on the Dignity of Man</i>, which has been called the "Manifesto of the Renaissance", and a key text of Renaissance humanism and of what has been called the "Hermetic Reformation". He was the founder of the tradition of Christian Kabbalah, a key tenet of early modern Western esotericism. His <i>900 Theses</i> was the first printed book to be universally banned by the Church.</p>',

            'description' => '<p><b>Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus</b> (<span></span>; 28 October 1466 – 12 July 1536), known as <b>Erasmus</b> or <b>Erasmus of Rotterdam</b>, was a Dutch Christian Humanist who was the greatest scholar of the northern Renaissance. Originally trained as a Catholic priest, Erasmus was an important figure in classical scholarship who wrote in a pure Latin style. Among humanists he enjoyed the sobriquet "Prince of the Humanists", and has been called "the crowning glory of the Christian humanists". Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament, which raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation.  He also wrote <i>On Free Will,</i> <i>In Praise of Folly</i>, <i>Handbook of a Christian Knight</i>, <i>On Civility in Children</i>, <i>Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style</i>, <i>Julius Exclusus</i>, and many other works.
</p><p>Erasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious Reformation, but while he was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform, he kept his distance from Luther and Melanchthon and continued to recognise the authority of the pope, emphasizing a middle way with a deep respect for traditional faith, piety and grace, rejecting Luther\'s emphasis on faith alone.  Erasmus remained a member of the Roman Catholic Church all his life,
remaining committed to reforming the Church and its clerics\' abuses from within.  He also held to the Catholic doctrine of free will, which some Reformers rejected in favor of the doctrine of predestination.  His middle road ("Via Media") approach disappointed, and even angered, scholars in both camps.
</p><p>Erasmus died suddenly in Basel in 1536 while preparing to return to Brabant, and was buried in Basel Minster, the former cathedral of the city. A bronze statue of Erasmus was erected in 1622 in his city of birth, replacing an earlier work in stone.

He has often been called the father of modern political science. For many years he was a senior official in the Florentine Republic, with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He also wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is renowned by Italian scholars. He was secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power. He wrote his most well-known work <i>The Prince</i> (<i>Il Principe</i>) in 1513, having been exiled from city affairs.
</p><p><i>Machiavellianism</i> is widely used as a negative term to characterize unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli described most famously in <i>The Prince.</i> Machiavelli described immoral behavior, such as dishonesty and the killing of innocents, as being normal and effective in politics. He even seemed to encourage it in some situations. The book gained notoriety due to claims that it teaches "evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power".</p><p>The term <i>Machiavellian</i> is often associated with political deceit, deviousness, and realpolitik. On the other hand, many commentators, such as Baruch Spinoza, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Denis Diderot, have argued that Machiavelli was actually a republican, even when writing <i>The Prince</i>, and his writings were an inspiration to Enlightenment proponents of modern democratic political philosophy. In one place, for example, he noted his admiration for the selfless Roman dictator Cincinnatus.</p>',

<p><b>Sir Thomas More</b> (7 February 1478 –  6 July 1535), venerated in the Catholic Church as <b>Saint Thomas More</b>, was an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman, and noted Renaissance humanist. He was also a councillor to Henry VIII, and Lord High Chancellor of England from October 1529 to 16 May 1532. He wrote <i>Utopia</i>, published in 1516, about the political system of an imaginary, ideal island nation.
</p><p>More opposed the Protestant Reformation, in particular the theology of Martin Luther and William Tyndale. More also opposed the king\'s separation from the Catholic Church, refusing to acknowledge Henry as Supreme Head of the Church of England and the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. After refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy, he was convicted of treason and beheaded. Of his execution, he was reported to  have said: "I die the King\'s good servant, but God\'s first."
</p><p>Pope Pius XI canonised More in 1935 as a martyr. Pope John Paul II in 2000 declared him the "heavenly Patron of Statesmen and Politicians". Since 1980, the Church of England has remembered More liturgically as a Reformation martyr. The Soviet Union honoured him for the purportedly communist attitude toward property rights expressed in <i>Utopia</i>.</p>',

<p><b>Martin Luther</b>,  (<span></span>;  <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈmaɐ̯tiːn ˈlʊtɐ]</span>; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546) was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk, and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. 
</p><p>Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the Catholic view on indulgences. Luther proposed an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his <i>Ninety-five Theses</i> of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Holy Roman Emperor.
</p><p>Luther taught that salvation and, consequently, eternal life are not earned by good deeds but are received only as the free gift of God\'s grace through the believer\'s faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin. His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with these, and all of Luther\'s wider teachings, are called Lutherans, though Luther insisted on <i>Christian</i> or <i>Evangelical</i> (German: <i>evangelisch</i>) as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ.
</p><p>His translation of the Bible into the German vernacular (instead of Latin) made it more accessible to the laity, an event that had a tremendous impact on both the church and German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the writing of an English translation, the Tyndale Bible. His hymns influenced the development of singing in Protestant churches. His marriage to Katharina von Bora, a former nun, set a model for the practice of clerical marriage, allowing Protestant clergy to marry.</p><p>In two of his later works, Luther expressed antagonistic views towards Jews. His rhetoric was not alone directed at Jews, but also towards Roman Catholics (whom Protestants labeled "Papists"), Anabaptists, and nontrinitarian Christians. Martin Luther died in 1546, with his decree of excommunication by Pope Leo X still effective. On his deathbed, Luther was asked: "Are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name?" He answered "Yes", before taking his final breath.</p>',

<p><b>John Calvin</b> (<span></span>;French: <i lang="fr">Jean Calvin</i> <small></small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʒɑ̃ kalvɛ̃]</span>; born <b>Jehan Cauvin</b>; 10 July 1509 – 27 May 1564) was a French theologian, pastor and reformer in Geneva during the Protestant Reformation.  He was a principal figure in the development of the system of Christian theology later called Calvinism, aspects of which include the doctrines of predestination and of the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation of the human soul from death and eternal damnation, in which doctrines Calvin was influenced by and elaborated upon the Augustinian and other Christian traditions.  Various Congregational, Reformed and Presbyterian churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world.
</p><p>Calvin was a tireless polemic and apologetic writer who generated much controversy.  He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including Philipp Melanchthon and Heinrich Bullinger.  In addition to his seminal <i>Institutes of the Christian Religion</i>, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, confessional documents, and various other theological treatises.
</p><p>Originally trained as a humanist lawyer, he broke from the Roman Catholic Church around 1530.  After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against Protestant Christians in France, Calvin fled to Basel, Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the <i>Institutes</i>.  In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman William Farel to join the Reformation in Geneva, where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week; but the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled.  At the invitation of Martin Bucer, Calvin proceeded to Strasbourg, where he became the minister of a church of French refugees.  He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.
</p><p>Following his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and liturgy, despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority.  During this period, Michael Servetus, a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a heretical view of the Trinity, arrived in Geneva.  He was denounced by Calvin and burned at the stake for heresy by the city council.  Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin\'s opponents were forced out.  Calvin spent his final years promoting the Reformation both in Geneva and throughout Europe.

<p><b>Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, Lord of Montaigne</b> (<span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[miʃɛl ekɛm də mɔ̃tɛɲ]</span>; 28 February 1533 – 13 September 1592) was one of the most significant philosophers of the French Renaissance, known for popularizing the essay as a literary genre. His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes and autobiography with serious intellectual insight; his massive volume <i>Essais</i> contains some of the most influential essays ever written.
</p><p>Montaigne had a direct influence on Western writers, including Francis Bacon, René Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Albert Hirschman, William Hazlitt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, Stefan Zweig, Eric Hoffer, Isaac Asimov, and possibly on the later works of William Shakespeare.
</p><p>In his own lifetime, Montaigne was admired more as a statesman than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that, "I am myself the matter of my book", was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne would come to be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt which began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his skeptical remark, "<i>Que sçay-je</i>?" ("What do I know?", in Middle French; now rendered as <i>Que sais-je?</i> in modern French).

<p><b>Giordano Bruno</b> (<span></span>; <small>Italian: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[dʒorˈdaːno ˈbruːno]</span>; Latin: <i lang="la">Iordanus Brunus Nolanus</i>; born <b>Filippo Bruno</b>, 1548 – 17 February 1600) was an Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician, poet, and cosmological theorist. He is known for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended the then-novel Copernican model. He proposed that the stars were distant suns surrounded by their own exoplanets and raised the possibility that these planets could foster life of their own, a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism. He also insisted that the universe is infinite and could have no celestial body at its "center".
</p><p>Starting in 1593, Bruno was tried for heresy by the Roman Inquisition on charges of denial of several core Catholic doctrines, including eternal damnation, the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the virginity of Mary, and transubstantiation. Bruno\'s pantheism was also a matter of grave concern, as was his teaching of the transmigration of the soul. The Inquisition found him guilty, and he was burned at the stake in Rome\'s Campo de\' Fiori in 1600. After his death, he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as a martyr for science, although historians have debated the extent to which his heresy trial was a response to his astronomical views or to other aspects of his philosophy and theology.
Bruno\'s case is still considered a landmark in the history of free thought and the emerging sciences.</p><p>In addition to cosmology, Bruno also wrote extensively on the art of memory, a loosely organized group of mnemonic techniques and principles. Historian Frances Yates argues that Bruno was deeply influenced by Arab astrology (particularly the philosophy of Averroes), Neoplatonism, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Genesis-like legends surrounding the Egyptian god Thoth. Other studies of Bruno have focused on his qualitative approach to mathematics and his application of the spatial concepts of geometry to language.</p>',

<p><b>Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Alban</b>,  (<span></span>; 22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626) was an English philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist, orator, and author. He served both as Attorney General and as Lord Chancellor of England. After his death, his works remained influential in the development of the scientific method during the scientific revolution.
</p><p>Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the <i>Baconian method</i>, did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories—history, poetry, and philosophy—which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings.
</p><p>Bacon is the first recipient of the Queen\'s counsel designation and was conferred in 1597 when Queen Elizabeth reserved Bacon as her legal advisor. After the accession of King James I in 1603,  Bacon was knighted. He was later created Baron Verulam in 1618 and Viscount St. Alban in 1621. Because he had no heirs, both titles became extinct upon his death in 1626, at 65 years of age.  Bacon died of pneumonia, with one account by John Aubrey stating that he had contracted the condition while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat. He is buried at St Michael\'s Church, St Albans, Hertfordshire.</p>',

<p><b>Galileo Galilei</b> (<small>Italian: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɡaliˈlɛːo ɡaliˈlɛi]</span>; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath. Galileo has been called the "father of observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of the scientific method", and the "father of modern science".</p><p>Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and "hydrostatic balances", inventing the thermoscope and various military compasses, and using the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the observation of Saturn and the analysis of sunspots.
</p><p>Galileo\'s championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system. He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture." Galileo later defended his views in <i>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</i> (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. While under house arrest, he wrote <i>Two New Sciences</i>, in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.</p>',

<p><b>Hugo Grotius</b> (<span></span>; 10 April 1583 – 28 August 1645), also known as <b>Huig de Groot</b> (<small>Dutch: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈɦœyɣ də ɣroːt]</span>) or <b>Hugo de Groot</b> (<small>Dutch: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈɦyɣoː də ɣroːt]</span>), was a Dutch jurist. Along with the earlier works of Francisco de Vitoria and Alberico Gentili, Grotius laid the foundations for international law, based on natural law. A teenage intellectual prodigy, he was imprisoned for his involvement in the intra-Calvinist disputes of the Dutch Republic, but escaped hidden in a chest of books. He wrote most of his major works in exile in France.
</p><p>It is thought that Hugo Grotius was not the first to formulate the international society doctrine, but he was one of the first to define expressly the idea of one society of states, governed not by force or warfare but by actual laws and mutual agreement to enforce those laws. As Hedley Bull declared in 1990: "The idea of international society which Grotius propounded was given concrete expression in the Peace of Westphalia, and Grotius may be considered the intellectual father of this first general peace settlement of modern times."</p><p>Additionally, his contributions to Arminian theology helped provide the seeds for later Arminian-based movements, such as Methodism and Pentecostalism, and he is acknowledged as a significant figure in the Arminianism–Calvinism debate. Because of his theological underpinning of free trade, he is also considered an "economic theologist".</p>',

He is perhaps best known today among mathematicians for Mersenne prime numbers, those which can be written in the form <span><i>M<sub>n</sub></i> = 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> − 1</span> for some integer <span><i>n</i></span>.  He also developed Mersenne\'s laws, which describe the harmonics of a vibrating string (such as may be found on guitars and pianos), and his seminal work on music theory, <i>Harmonie universelle</i>, for which he is referred to as the "father of acoustics". Mersenne, an ordained priest, had many contacts in the scientific world and has been called "the center of the world of science and mathematics during the first half of the 1600s" and, because of his ability to make connections between people and ideas, "the post-box of Europe".  He was also a member of the Minim religious order and wrote and lectured on theology and philosophy.

<p><b>Sir Robert Filmer</b> (c. 1588 – 26 May 1653) was an English political theorist who defended the divine right of kings. His best known work, <i>Patriarcha</i>, published posthumously in 1680, was the target of numerous Whig attempts at rebuttal, including Algernon Sidney\'s <i>Discourses Concerning Government</i>, James Tyrrell\'s <i>Patriarcha Non Monarcha</i> and John Locke\'s <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>. Filmer also wrote critiques of Thomas Hobbes, John Milton, Hugo Grotius and Aristotle.

While he held a church position in south-east France, he also spent much time in Paris, where he was a leader of a group of free-thinking intellectuals. He was also an active observational scientist, publishing the first data on the transit of Mercury in 1631. The lunar crater Gassendi is named after him.
</p><p>He wrote numerous philosophical works, and some of the positions he worked out are considered significant, finding a way between skepticism and dogmatism. Richard Popkin indicates that Gassendi was one of the first thinkers to formulate the modern "scientific outlook", of moderated skepticism and empiricism. He clashed with his contemporary Descartes on the possibility of certain knowledge. His best known intellectual project attempted to reconcile Epicurean atomism with Christianity.

<b>René Descartes</b> (<span></span>, <span>UK also</span> <span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʁəne dekaʁt]</span>; Latinized: <b>Renatus Cartesius</b>; adjectival form: "Cartesian"; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist. A native of the Kingdom of France, he spent about 20 years (1629–49) of his life in the Dutch Republic after serving for a while in the Dutch States Army of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and the Stadtholder of the United Provinces. He is generally considered one of the most notable intellectual representatives of the Dutch Golden Age.</p><p>Descartes\' <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> (1641) continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes\' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the Cartesian coordinate system (see below) was named after him. He is credited as the father of analytical geometry, the bridge between algebra and geometry, used in the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the Scientific Revolution.
</p><p>Descartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers. He frequently set his views apart from those of his predecessors. In the opening section of the <i>Passions of the Soul</i>, an early modern treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic "as if no one had written on these matters before". His best known philosophical statement is "I think, therefore I am" (French: <i lang="fr">Je pense, donc je suis</i>; Latin: <i lang="la">Ego cogito, ergo sum</i>), found in <i>Discourse on the Method</i> (1637; written in French and Latin) and <i>Principles of Philosophy</i> (1644; written in Latin).</p><p>Many elements of his philosophy have precedents in late Aristotelianism, the revived Stoicism of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like Augustine. In his natural philosophy, he differed from the schools on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to final ends, divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena. In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God\'s act of creation.
</p><p>Descartes laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism, later advocated by Spinoza and Leibniz, and opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. Leibniz, Spinoza, and Descartes were all well versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and Descartes and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well.

</p>
<p><b>Thomas Hobbes</b> (<span></span>; 5 April 1588 – 4 December 1679), in some older texts <b>Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury</b>, was an English philosopher who is considered one of the founders of modern political philosophy. Hobbes is best known for his 1651 book <i>Leviathan</i>, which expounded an influential formulation of social contract theory. In addition to political philosophy, Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of other fields, including history, jurisprudence, geometry, the physics of gases, theology, ethics, and general philosophy.
</p><p>Though on rational grounds a champion of absolutism for the sovereign, Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law that leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid. His understanding of humans as being matter and motion, obeying the same physical laws as other matter and motion, remains influential; and his account of human nature as self-interested cooperation, and of political communities as being based upon a "social contract" remains one of the major topics of political philosophy.

<p><b>Blaise Pascal</b> (<span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[blɛz paskal]</span>; 19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer and Catholic theologian. He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. Pascal\'s earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method.
</p><p>In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes, he built 20 finished machines (called Pascal\'s calculators and later Pascalines) over the following 10 years, establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.</p><p>Pascal was an important mathematician, helping create two major new areas of research: he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16, and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. Following Galileo Galilei and Torricelli, in 1647, he rebutted Aristotle\'s followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum. Pascal\'s results caused many disputes before being accepted.
</p><p>In 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism. Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the <i>Lettres provinciales</i> and the <i>Pensées</i>, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids.
</p><p>Throughout his life, Pascal was in frail health, especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.</p>',

<p><b>Margaret Lucas Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne </b>(1623 – 15 December 1673) was an English aristocrat, philosopher, poet, scientist, fiction-writer, and playwright during the 17th century. Born <b>Margaret Lucas</b>, she was the youngest sister of prominent royalists Sir John Lucas and Sir Charles Lucas, who owned the manor of St. John\'s Abbey in Colchester. She became an attendant of Queen Henrietta Maria and traveled with her into exile in France, living for a time at the court of the young King Louis XIV. She became the second wife of William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1645, when he was a marquess.</p><p>Cavendish was a poet, philosopher, writer of prose romances, essayist, and playwright who published under her own name at a time when most women writers published anonymously. Her writing addressed a number of topics, including gender, power, manners, scientific method, and philosophy. Her utopian romance, <i>The Blazing World</i>, is one of the earliest examples of science fiction. She is singular in having published extensively in natural philosophy and early modern science. She published over a dozen original works; inclusion of her revised works brings her total number of publications to twenty-one.</p><p>Cavendish has been championed and criticized as a unique and groundbreaking woman writer. She rejected the Aristotelianism and mechanical philosophy of the seventeenth century, preferring a vitalist model instead. She was the first woman to attend a meeting at Royal Society of London in 1667 and she criticized and engaged with members and philosophers Thomas Hobbes, René Descartes, and Robert Boyle. She has been claimed as an advocate for animals and as an early opponent of animal testing.</p>

<p><b>Robert Boyle</b>  (<span></span>; 25 January 1627 – 31 December 1691) was an Anglo-Irish natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, and inventor. Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method. He is best known for Boyle\'s law, which describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system. Among his works, <i>The Sceptical Chymist</i> is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry. He was a devout and pious Anglican and is noted for his writings in theology.</p>',

<p><b>Baruch Spinoza</b> (<span></span>; <small>Dutch: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[baːˈrux spɪˈnoːzaː]</span>; born <b>Benedito de Espinosa</b>, <small>Portuguese: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[bɨnɨˈðitu ðɨ ʃpiˈnɔzɐ]</span>; 24 November 1632 – 21 February 1677, later <b>Benedict de Spinoza</b>) was a Jewish-Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Sephardi origin. By laying the groundwork for the Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy. Along with René Descartes, Spinoza was a leading philosophical figure of the Dutch Golden Age. Spinoza\'s given name, which means "Blessed", varies among different languages. In Hebrew, it is written <span dir="rtl">ברוך שפינוזה</span>‬. His Portuguese name is <i lang="pt" title="Portuguese language text">Benedito "Bento" de Espinosa</i>. In his Latin works, he used Latin: <i lang="la">Benedictus de Spinoza</i>.
</p><p>Spinoza was raised in a Portuguese-Jewish community in Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine. Jewish religious authorities issued a <i>herem</i> (<span dir="rtl">חרם</span>‬) against him, causing him to be effectively shunned by Jewish society at age 23. His books were also later put on the Catholic Church\'s <i>Index of Forbidden Books</i>.
</p><p>Spinoza lived an outwardly simple life as an optical lens grinder, collaborating on microscope and telescope lens designs with Constantijn and Christiaan Huygens. He turned down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 in 1677 from a lung illness, perhaps tuberculosis or silicosis exacerbated by the inhalation of fine glass dust while grinding lenses. He is buried in the churchyard of the Christian Nieuwe Kerk in The Hague.</p><p>Spinoza\'s <i>magnum opus</i>, the <i>Ethics</i>, was published posthumously in the year of his death. The work opposed Descartes\' philosophy of mind–body dualism, and earned Spinoza recognition as one of Western philosophy\'s most important thinkers. In it, "Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely". Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel said, "The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all." His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted Gilles Deleuze to name him "the \'prince\' of philosophers."</p>',

</p>

<p><b>John Locke</b>  (<span></span>; 29 August 1632 – 28 October 1704) was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the "Father of Liberalism". Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Sir Francis Bacon, he is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence.</p><p>Locke\'s theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as David Hume, Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of consciousness. He postulated that, at birth, the mind was a blank slate or <i>tabula rasa</i>. Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception. This is now known as empiricism. An example of Locke\'s belief in empiricism can be seen in his quote, "whatever I write, as soon as I discover it not to be true, my hand shall be the forwardest to throw it into the fire." This shows the ideology of science in his observations in that something must be capable of being tested repeatedly and that nothing is exempt from being disproven. Challenging the work of others, Locke is said to have established the method of introspection, or observing the emotions and behaviours of one’s self.</p>',

<p><b>Sir Isaac Newton</b>  (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, theologian, author and physicist (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and a key figure in the scientific revolution.  His book <i>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i> ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics.  Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.
</p><p>In <i>Principia</i>, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until being superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to prove Kepler\'s laws of planetary motion, account for the trajectories of comets, tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System\'s heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton\'s prediction that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.
</p><p>Newton also built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light was collected in his highly influential book <i>Opticks</i>, published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid.  In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.
</p><p>Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.  He was a devout but unorthodox Christian, who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and who, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, refused to take holy orders in the Church of England.  Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death.  Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–90 and 1701–02.  He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and he spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1700) and Master (1700–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).

<p><b>Damaris Cudworth, Lady Masham</b> (18 January 1659 – 20 April 1708) was an English theological writer and advocate for women\'s education who is characterized as a proto-feminist. She overcame some weakness of eyesight and lack of access to formal higher education to win high regard among eminent thinkers of her time. With an extensive correspondence, she published two works, <i>A Discourse Concerning the Love of God</i> (1696) and <i>Thoughts in reference to a Vertuous or Christian Life</i> (1705). She is particularly noted for her long, mutually-influential friendship with the philosopher John Locke.

<p><b>Gottfried Wilhelm</b> (<b>von</b>) <b>Leibniz</b> (sometimes spelled <b>Leibnitz</b>) (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈɡɔtfʁiːt ˈvɪlhɛlm fɔn ˈlaɪbnɪts]</span> or <small></small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈlaɪpnɪts]</span>; French: <i lang="fr">Godefroi Guillaume Leibnitz</i>; 1 July 1646 [O.S. 21 June] – 14 November 1716) was a prominent German polymath and philosopher in the history of mathematics and the history of philosophy.  His most notable accomplishment was conceiving the ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton\'s contemporaneous developments. Mathematical works have always favored Leibniz\'s notation as the conventional expression of calculus, while Newton\'s notation became unused. It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz\'s law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found mathematical implementation (by means of non-standard analysis). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal\'s calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of all digital computers.
</p><p>In philosophy, Leibniz is most noted for his optimism, i.e. his conclusion that our universe is, in a restricted sense, the best possible one that God could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as Voltaire. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great 17th-century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.
</p><p>Leibniz made major contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy, probability theory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. He wrote works on philosophy, politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and philology. Leibniz also contributed to the field of library science. While serving as overseer of the Wolfenbüttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would serve as a guide for many of Europe\'s largest libraries.  Leibniz\'s contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various learned journals, in tens of thousands of letters, and in unpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, but primarily in Latin, French, and German. There is no complete gathering of the writings of Leibniz translated into English.</p>',

He criticized the expansion and development of modern rationalism, was an apologist for Classical Antiquity, a precursor of systematic and complex thought, in opposition to Cartesian analysis and other types of reductionism, and was the first expositor of the fundamentals of social science and of semiotics. 
</p><p>The Latin aphorism <i>Verum esse ipsum factum</i> ("What is true is precisely what is made") coined by Vico is an early instance of constructivist epistemology. He inaugurated the modern field of the philosophy of history, and, although the term <i>philosophy of history</i> is not in his writings, Vico spoke of a “history of philosophy narrated philosophically." Although he was not an historicist, contemporary interest in Vico usually has been motivated by historicists, such as Isaiah Berlin, an historian of ideas, Edward Said, a literary critic, and Hayden White, a metahistorian.</p><p>Giambattista Vico\'s intellectual <i>magnum opus</i> is the book <i>Scienza Nuova</i> (1725, <i>New Science</i>), which attempts a systematic organization of the humanities as a single science that recorded and explained the historical cycles by which societies rise and fall.</p>',

<p><b>Catharine Trotter Cockburn</b> (16 August 1679 – 11 May 1749) was a novelist, dramatist, and philosopher. She wrote on moral philosophy,  theological tracts, and had a voluminous correspondence.
</p><p>Trotter\'s work addresses a range of issues including necessity, the infinitude of space, and the substance, but she focuses on moral issues. She thought that moral principles are not innate, but discoverable by each individual through the use of the faculty of reason endowed by God. In 1702, she published her first major philosophical work, <i>A Defence of Mr. Lock\'s [sic.] An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>.  John Locke was so pleased with this defence that he made gifts of money and books to his young apologist acting through Elizabeth Burnet who had first made Locke aware of Trotter\'s "Defence".</p><p>Her work attracted the attention of William Warburton, who prefaced her last philosophical work.  She also had a request from the biographer Thomas Birch to aid him in compiling a collection of her works.  She agreed to the project but died before the work could be printed.  Birch posthumously published a two-volume collection entitled <i>The Works of Mrs. Catharine Cockburn, Theological, Moral, Dramatic, and Poetical</i> in 1751. It is largely through this text that readers and history have come to know her.

</p><p>Wolff was also the creator of German as the language of scholarly instruction and research, although he also wrote in Latin, so that an international audience could, and did, read him.  A founding father of, among other fields, economics and public administration as academic disciplines, he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in government, and stressing the professional nature of university education.

<p><b>George Berkeley</b> (<span></span>; 12 March 1685 – 14 January 1753) — known as <b>Bishop Berkeley</b> (Bishop of Cloyne) — was an Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called "immaterialism" (later referred to as "subjective idealism" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only ideas in the minds of perceivers and, as a result, cannot exist without being perceived. Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction, an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.
</p><p>Berkeley was the namesake of the city of Berkeley, California, which is perhaps most famous as the home of the prestigious university.
</p>

<p>In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, <i>An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision</i>, in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour. This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work, <i>A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge</i>, in 1710, which, after its poor reception, he rewrote in dialogue form and published under the title <i>Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous</i> in 1713.</p><p>In this book, Berkeley\'s views were represented by Philonous (Greek: "lover of mind"), while Hylas (Greek: "matter") embodies the Irish thinker\'s opponents, in particular John Locke.
Berkeley argued against Isaac Newton\'s doctrine of absolute space, time and motion in <i>De Motu</i> (On Motion), published 1721. His arguments were a precursor to the views of Mach and Einstein.  In 1732, he published <i>Alciphron</i>, a Christian apologetic against the free-thinkers, and in 1734, he published <i>The Analyst</i>, a critique of the foundations of calculus, which was influential in the development of mathematics.
</p><p>His last major philosophical work, <i>Siris</i> (1744), begins by advocating the medicinal use of tar water and then continues to discuss a wide range of topics, including science, philosophy, and theology. Interest in Berkeley\'s work increased after World War II because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century, such as the problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.</p>',

</p><p>Voltaire was a versatile and prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays and historical and scientific works. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties, despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a satirical polemicist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma and the French institutions of his day.

</p>
<p><b>David Hume</b> (<span></span>; born <b>David Home</b>; 7 May 1711 NS <small>(26 April 1711 OS)</small> – 25 August 1776) was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist, who is best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism. Hume\'s empiricist approach to philosophy places him with John Locke, George Berkeley, Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes as a British Empiricist. Beginning with his <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i> (1739), Hume strove to create a total naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Against philosophical rationalists, Hume held that passion rather than reason governs human behaviour. Hume argued against the existence of innate ideas, positing that all human knowledge is founded solely in experience; Hume thus held that genuine knowledge must either be directly traceable to objects perceived in experience, or result from abstract reasoning about relations between ideas which are derived from experience, calling the rest "nothing but sophistry and illusion", a dichotomy later given the name <i>Hume\'s fork</i>.
</p><p>In what is sometimes referred to as Hume\'s problem of induction, he argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, our trust in causality and induction result from custom and mental habit, and are attributable only to the experience of "constant conjunction" of events.  This is because we can never actually perceive that one event causes another, but only that the two are always conjoined.  Accordingly, to draw any causal inferences from past experience it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past, a presupposition which cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.</p><p>Hume\'s opposition to the teleological argument for God\'s existence, the argument from design, is generally regarded as the most intellectually significant attempt to rebut the argument prior to Darwinism.
</p><p>Hume was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions". Hume\'s moral theory has been seen as a unique attempt to synthesise the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the virtue ethics tradition of ancient philosophy, with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than acts or their consequences, as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation. Hume maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena, and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the is–ought problem, or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what <i>ought</i> to be done. Hume also denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only  a bundle of sensations, and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume\'s compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom.</p><p>Hume influenced utilitarianism, logical positivism, Immanuel Kant, the philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive science, theology, and other movements and thinkers. Kant himself credited Hume as the spur to his philosophical thought who had awakened him from his "dogmatic slumbers".

Born in Geneva, his political philosophy influenced the progress of the Enlightenment throughout Europe, as well as aspects of the French Revolution and the development of modern political and educational thought.
</p><p>He befriended fellow philosophy writer Denis Diderot in 1742, and would later write about Diderot\'s romantic troubles in his autobiography, <i>Confessions</i>.
</p><p>His <i>Discourse on Inequality</i> and <i>The Social Contract</i> are cornerstones in modern political and social thought. Rousseau\'s sentimental novel <i>Julie, or the New Heloise</i> (1761) was important to the development of preromanticism and romanticism in fiction. His <i>Emile, or On Education</i> (1762) is an educational treatise on the place of the individual in society. Rousseau\'s autobiographical writings—the posthumously published <i>Confessions</i> (composed in 1769), which initiated the modern autobiography, and the unfinished <i>Reveries of a Solitary Walker</i> (composed 1776–1778)—exemplified the late-18th-century "Age of Sensibility", and featured an increased focus on subjectivity and introspection that later characterized modern writing.
</p><p>During the period of the French Revolution, Rousseau was the most popular of the philosophers among members of the Jacobin Club. He was interred as a national hero in the Panthéon in Paris, in 1794, 16 years after his death.

<p><b>Denis Diderot</b> (<small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[dəni did(ə)ʁo]</span>; 5 October 1713 – 31 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer, best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the <i>Encyclopédie</i> along with Jean le Rond d\'Alembert. He was a prominent figure during the Enlightenment.
</p><p>Diderot began his education by obtaining a Master of Arts degree in philosophy at a Jesuit college in 1732. He considered working in the church clergy before briefly studying law. When he decided to become a writer in 1734, his father disowned him for not entering one of the learned professions. He lived a bohemian existence for the next decade. He befriended philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in 1742.
</p><p>Though his work was broad as well as rigorous, it did not bring Diderot riches. He secured none of the posts that were occasionally given to needy men of letters; he could not even obtain the bare official recognition of merit that was implied by being chosen a member of the Académie française. He saw no alternative to selling his library to provide a dowry for his daughter. Empress Catherine II of Russia heard of his financial troubles and commissioned an agent in Paris to buy the library. She then requested that the philosopher retain the books in Paris until she required them, and act as her librarian with a yearly salary. Between October 1773 and March 1774, the sick Diderot spent a few months at the empress\'s court in Saint Petersburg.</p><p>Diderot died of pulmonary thrombosis in Paris on 31 July 1784, and was buried in the city\'s Église Saint-Roch. His heirs sent his vast library to Catherine II, who had it deposited at the National Library of Russia. He has several times been denied burial in the Panthéon with other French notables. The French government considered memorializing him in this fashion on the 300th anniversary of his birth, but this did not come to pass.
</p><p>Diderot\'s literary reputation during his lifetime rested primarily on his plays and his contributions to the <i>Encyclopédie</i>; many of his most important works, including <i>Jacques the Fatalist, Rameau\'s Nephew</i>, <i>Paradox of the Actor</i>, and <i>D\'Alembert\'s Dream</i>, were published only after his death.</p>',

<p><b>Adam Smith</b>  (16 June [O.S. 5 June] 1723 – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist, philosopher and author as well as a moral philosopher, a pioneer of political economy and a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith is best known for two classic works, <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> (1759) and <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i> (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, is considered his <i>magnum opus</i> and the first modern work of economics.
</p><p>Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.
</p><p>Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift. In 2005, <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.</p>',

<p><b>Immanuel Kant</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʔɪˈmaːnu̯eːl ˈkant, -nu̯ɛl -]</span>; 22 April 1724 – 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher who is a central figure in modern philosophy. In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, he argued that space, time and causation are mere sensibilities; "things-in-themselves" exist, but their nature is unknowable. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience, with all human experience sharing certain structural features. He drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposition that worldly objects can be intuited <i>a priori</i> ("beforehand"), and that intuition is therefore independent from objective reality. Kant believed that reason is the source of morality, and that aesthetics arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant\'s views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political theory, and post-modern aesthetics.
</p><p>In one of Kant\'s major works, the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> (1781), he attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond the failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics. Kant wanted to put an end to an era of futile and speculative theories of human experience, while resisting the skepticism of thinkers such as David Hume. Kant regarded himself as ending and showing the way beyond the impasse which modern philosophy had led to between rationalists and empiricists, and is widely held to have synthesized these two early modern traditions in his thought.</p><p>Kant was an exponent of the idea that perpetual peace could be secured through universal democracy and international cooperation. He believed that this would be the eventual outcome of universal history, although it is not rationally planned. The nature of Kant\'s religious ideas continues to be the subject of philosophical dispute, with viewpoints ranging from the impression that he was an initial advocate of atheism who at some point developed an ontological argument for God, to more critical treatments epitomized by Nietzsche, who claimed that Kant had "theologian blood" and was merely a sophisticated apologist for traditional Christian faith.</p><p>Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These include the <i>Universal Natural History</i> (1755), the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i> (1788), the <i>Metaphysics of Morals</i> (1797), and the <i>Critique of Judgment</i> (1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.

</p>
<p><b>Edmund Burke</b> (<span></span>; 12 January [NS] 1730 – 9 July 1797) was an  Irish statesman born in Dublin, as well as an author, orator, political theorist and philosopher, who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament (MP) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons with the Whig Party.
</p><p>Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state. These views were expressed in his <i>A Vindication of Natural Society</i>. Burke criticized British treatment of the American colonies, including through its taxation policies. He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority, though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence. Burke is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation, the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company and for his staunch opposition to the French Revolution. In his <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i>, Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society, traditional institutions of state and society and condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it. This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party, which he dubbed the "Old Whigs", as opposed to the pro-French Revolution "New Whigs", led by Charles James Fox.</p><p>In the nineteenth century, Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals. Subsequently, in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism.</p>',

</p>

<p><b>Thomas Jefferson</b> (April 13, [O.S. April 2] 1743 – July 4, 1826) was an American Founding Father who was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and later served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Previously, he had been elected the second Vice President of the United States, serving under John Adams from 1797 to 1801. He was a proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights motivating American colonists to break from Great Britain and form a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level.
</p><p>Jefferson was mainly of English ancestry, born and educated in colonial Virginia. He graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary and briefly practiced law, with the largest number of his cases concerning land ownership claims. During the American Revolution, he represented Virginia in the Continental Congress that adopted the Declaration, drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator, and served as a wartime governor (1779–1781). He became the United States Minister to France in May 1785, and subsequently the nation\'s first Secretary of State in 1790–1793 under President George Washington. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the controversial Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798–1799, which sought to strengthen states\' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.
</p><p>As President, Jefferson pursued the nation\'s shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. He also organized the Louisiana Purchase, almost doubling the country\'s territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was reelected in 1804. Jefferson\'s second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr. American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act of 1807, responding to British threats to U.S. shipping. In 1803, Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribe removal to the newly organized Louisiana Territory, and he signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807.
</p><p>Jefferson, while primarily a planter, lawyer and politician, mastered many disciplines, which ranged from surveying and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics. He was an architect in the classical tradition. Jefferson\'s keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his presidency of the American Philosophical Society; he shunned organized religion but was influenced by both Christianity and deism. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people. His only full-length book is <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i> (1785), considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800. After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia.
</p><p>Although regarded as a leading spokesman for democracy and republicanism in the era of the Enlightenment, Jefferson\'s historical legacy is mixed. Some modern scholarship has been critical of Jefferson\'s private life, pointing out the contradiction between his ownership of the large numbers of slaves that worked his plantations and his famous declaration that "all men are created equal." Another point of controversy stems from the evidence that after his wife Martha died in 1782, Jefferson fathered children with Martha\'s half-sister, Sally Hemings, who was his slave. Nonetheless, presidential scholars and historians generally praise his public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia. Jefferson continues to rank highly among U.S. presidents.

<p><b>Jeremy Bentham</b> (<span></span>; 15 February 1748 [O.S. 4 February 1747] – 6 June 1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism.</p><p>Bentham defined as the "fundamental axiom" of his philosophy the principle that "it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong". He became a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law, and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of welfarism. He advocated for individual and economic freedoms, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts. He called for the abolition of slavery, of the death penalty, and of physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known as an early advocate of animal rights. Though strongly in favour of the extension of individual legal rights, he opposed the idea of natural law and natural rights (both of which are considered "divine" or "God-given" in origin), calling them "nonsense upon stilts".  Bentham was also a sharp critic of legal fictions.
</p><p>Bentham\'s students included his secretary and collaborator James Mill, the latter\'s son, John Stuart Mill, the legal philosopher John Austin, as well as Robert Owen, one of the founders of utopian socialism.  He "had considerable influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself."</p><p>On his death in 1832, Bentham left instructions for his body to be first dissected, and then to be permanently preserved as an "auto-icon" (or self-image), which would be his memorial. This was done, and the auto-icon is now on public display at University College London (UCL). Because of his arguments in favour of the general availability of education, he has been described as the "spiritual founder" of UCL. However, he played only a limited direct part in its foundation.</p>',

<p><b>William Godwin</b> (3 March 1756 – 7 April 1836) was an English journalist, political philosopher and novelist. He is considered one of the first exponents of utilitarianism and the first modern proponent of anarchism. Godwin is most famous for two books that he published within the space of a year: <i>An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</i>, an attack on political institutions, and <i>Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams</i>, an early mystery novel which attacks aristocratic privilege. Based on the success of both, Godwin featured prominently in the radical circles of London in the 1790s. He wrote prolifically in the genres of novels, history and demography throughout his lifetime.
</p><p>In the conservative reaction to British radicalism, Godwin was attacked, in part because of his marriage to the pioneering feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797 and his candid biography of her after her death from childbirth. Their daughter, later known as Mary Shelley, would go on to write <i>Frankenstein</i> and marry the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.  With his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, Godwin set up The Juvenile Library, allowing the family to write their own works for children (sometimes using <i>noms de plume</i>) and translate and publish many other books, some of enduring significance. Godwin has had considerable influence on British literature and literary culture.

<p><b>Mary Wollstonecraft</b> (27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of women\'s rights. During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children\'s book. Wollstonecraft is best known for <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i> (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.
</p><p>Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft\'s life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships, received more attention than her writing. After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38, eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. This daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, became an accomplished writer herself, as Mary Shelley, whose best known work was <i>Frankenstein</i>.
</p><p>After Wollstonecraft\'s death, her widower published a <i>Memoir</i> (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft\'s advocacy of women\'s equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.

<p><b>Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller</b> (<small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈjoːhan ˈkʁɪstɔf ˈfʁiːdʁɪç fɔn ˈʃɪlɐ]</span>; 10 November 1759 – 9 May 1805) was a German poet, philosopher, physician, historian, and playwright. During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller struck up a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. They frequently discussed issues concerning aesthetics, and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works he left as sketches. This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as Weimar Classicism. They also worked together on <i>Xenien</i>, a collection of short satirical poems in which both Schiller and Goethe challenge opponents of their philosophical vision.

Recently, philosophers and scholars have begun to appreciate Fichte as an important philosopher in his own right due to his original insights into the nature of self-consciousness or self-awareness. Fichte was also the originator of <i>thesis–antithesis–synthesis</i>, an idea that is often erroneously attributed to Hegel. Like Descartes and Kant before him, Fichte was motivated by the problem of subjectivity and consciousness. Fichte also wrote works of political philosophy; he has a reputation as one of the fathers of German nationalism.

            'description' => '<p><b>Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck</b> (1 August 1744 – 18 December 1829), often known simply as <b>Lamarck</b> (<span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[lamaʁk]</span>), was a French naturalist. He was a soldier, biologist, academic, and an early proponent of the idea that biological evolution occurred and proceeded in accordance with natural laws.  
</p><p>Lamarck fought in the Pomeranian War (1757–62) against Prussia, and was awarded a commission for bravery on the battlefield. Posted to Monaco, Lamarck became interested in natural history and resolved to study medicine. He retired from the army after being injured in 1766, and returned to his medical studies. Lamarck developed a particular interest in botany, and later, after he published the three-volume work <i>Flore françoise</i> (1778), he gained membership of the French Academy of Sciences in 1779. Lamarck became involved in the Jardin des Plantes and was appointed to the Chair of Botany in 1788. When the French National Assembly founded the Muséum national d\'Histoire naturelle in 1793, Lamarck became a professor of zoology.
</p><p>In 1801, he published <i>Système des animaux sans vertèbres</i>, a major work on the classification of invertebrates, a term he coined. In an 1802 publication he became one of the first to use the term <i>biology</i> in its modern sense. Lamarck continued his work as a premier authority on invertebrate zoology. He is remembered, at least in malacology, as a taxonomist of considerable stature.
</p><p>The modern era generally remembers Lamarck for a theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, called soft inheritance, Lamarckism or use/disuse theory, which he described in his 1809 <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i>. However, the idea of soft inheritance long predates him, formed only a small element of his theory of evolution, and was in his time accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck\'s contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of biological evolution, in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through <i>use and disuse</i> of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms. Scientists have debated whether advances in the field of transgenerational epigenetics mean that Lamarck was to an extent correct, or not.</p>',

<p><b>Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace</b> (<span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[pjɛʁ simɔ̃ laplas]</span>; 23 March 1749 – 5 March 1827) was a French scholar whose work was important to the development of mathematics, statistics, physics and astronomy. He summarized and extended the work of his predecessors in his five-volume <i>Mécanique Céleste</i> (<i>Celestial Mechanics</i>) (1799–1825). This work translated the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus, opening up a broader range of problems. In statistics, the Bayesian interpretation of probability was developed mainly by Laplace.</p><p>Laplace formulated Laplace\'s equation, and pioneered the Laplace transform which appears in many branches of mathematical physics, a field that he took a leading role in forming. The Laplacian differential operator, widely used in mathematics, is also named after him. He restated and developed the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the Solar System and was one of the first scientists to postulate the existence of black holes and the notion of gravitational collapse.
</p><p>Laplace is remembered as one of the greatest scientists of all time. Sometimes referred to as the <i>French Newton</i> or <i>Newton of France</i>, he has been described as possessing a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of any of his contemporaries.
He was Napoleon\'s examiner when Napoleon attended the Ecole Militaire in Paris in 1784.
Laplace became a count of the Empire in 1806 and was named a marquis in 1817, after the Bourbon Restoration.

<p><b>Joseph-Marie, Comte de Maistre</b> (<small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[də mɛstʁ]</span>; 1 April 1753 – 26 February 1821) was a French-speaking Savoyard philosopher, writer, lawyer, and diplomat, who advocated social hierarchy and monarchy in the period immediately following the French Revolution. Despite his close personal and intellectual ties with France, Maistre was throughout his life a subject of the King of Piedmont-Sardinia, whom he served as member of the Savoy Senate (1787–1792), ambassador to Russia (1803–1817), and minister of state to the court in Turin (1817–1821).</p><p>A key figure of the "Counter-Enlightenment", Maistre regarded monarchy as both a divinely sanctioned institution and as the only stable form of government. He called for the restoration of the House of Bourbon to the throne of France and for the ultimate authority of the Pope in temporal matters. Maistre argued that the rationalist rejection of Christianity was directly responsible for the disorder and bloodshed which followed the French Revolution of 1789.</p>',

</p><p>He created a political and economic ideology known as <i>industrialism</i> that claimed that the needs of an <i>industrial class</i>, which he also referred to as the working class, needed to be recognized and fulfilled to have an effective society and an efficient economy. Unlike later conceptions by others of a working class being manual labourers alone, Saint-Simon\'s conception of this class included all people engaged in productive work that contributed to society, that included businesspeople, managers, scientists, bankers, along with manual labourers amongst others. He said the primary threat to the needs of the industrial class was another class he referred to as the <i>idling class</i>, that included able people who preferred to be parasitic and benefit from the work of others while seeking to avoid doing work. Saint-Simon stressed the need for recognition of the merit of the individual and the need for hierarchy of merit in society and in the economy, such as society having hierarchical merit-based organizations of managers and scientists to be the decision-makers in government. He strongly criticized any expansion of government intervention into the economy beyond ensuring no hindrances to productive work and reducing idleness in society, regarding intervention beyond these as too intrusive.</p><p>This ideology soon inspired and influenced utopian socialism, liberal political theorist John Stuart Mill, anarchism through its founder Pierre-Joseph Proudhon who was inspired by Saint-Simon\'s thought and Marxism with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels identifying Saint-Simon as an inspiration to their ideas and identifying him among the utopian socialists. However historian Alan Ryan regards certain followers of Saint-Simon, rather than Saint-Simon himself, as being responsible for the rise of utopian socialism that based itself upon Saint-Simon\'s ideas. He also regards strong differences as existing between Saint-Simon\'s conceptions and Marxism\'s as Saint-Simon did not promote class conflict as a solution to societal problems nor did he adhere to the narrower definition of the working class as manual labourers as defined by Marxists. Saint-Simon unlike Marx did not regard the prevalent form of ownership as being paramount issue in the economy but rather the form of management. Furthermore, Saint-Simon held no opposition to capitalists as a whole unlike Marx and he regarded them as an important component of the industrial class. Later Saint-Simon\'s views influenced sociologist and economist Thorstein Veblen, including Veblen\'s creation of institutional economics that has included prominent economists as adherents. Historian Alan Ryan states that by the 1950s it was clear that Saint-Simon had invented the modern understanding of industrial society and its organization.</p><p>Saint-Simon and his secretary Auguste Comte developed what Comte would complete as sociology.

<p><b>Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein</b> (<small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[stal]</span>; née <b>Necker</b>; 22 April 1766 – 14 July 1817), commonly known as <b>Madame de Staël</b>, was a French woman of letters of Genevan origin whose lifetime overlapped with the events of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era. For many years she lived as an exile under the Reign of Terror and under Napoleonic persecution. Known as a witty and brilliant conversationalist, often dressed in flashy and revealing outfits, she participated actively in the political and intellectual life of her times. She was present at the first opening of the Estates General and at the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Her intellectual collaboration with Benjamin Constant between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of their time. They discovered sooner than others the tyrannical character and designs of Napoleon. In 1814 one of her contemporaries observed that "there are three great powers struggling against Napoleon for the soul of Europe: England, Russia, and Madame de Staël". Her works, both novels and travel literature, with emphasis on passion, individuality and oppositional politics made their mark on European Romanticism.

The neo-orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

He achieved wide recognition in his day and—while primarily influential within the continental tradition of philosophy—has become increasingly influential in the analytic tradition as well. Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within Western philosophy is universally recognized.
</p><p>Hegel\'s principal achievement was his development of a distinctive articulation of idealism, sometimes termed <i>absolute idealism</i>, in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and subject and object are overcome. His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion and philosophy. His account of the master–slave dialectic has been highly influential, especially in 20th-century France. Of special importance is his concept of spirit (<i>Geist</i>, sometimes also translated as "mind") as the historical manifestation of the logical concept and the "sublation" (<i>Aufhebung</i>, integration without elimination or reduction) of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors: examples include the apparent opposition between nature and freedom and between immanence and transcendence. Hegel has been seen in the 20th century as the originator of the thesis, antithesis, synthesis triad, but as an explicit phrase it originated with Johann Gottlieb Fichte.</p><p>Hegel has influenced many thinkers and writers whose own positions vary widely. Karl Barth described Hegel as a "Protestant Aquinas" while Maurice Merleau-Ponty wrote that "all the great philosophical ideas of the past century—the philosophies of Marx and Nietzsche, phenomenology, German existentialism, and psychoanalysis—had their beginnings in Hegel."</p>',

His son, John Stuart Mill, was also a noted philosopher of liberalism, utilitarianism and the civilizing mission of the British Empire.
</p><p>Although he never set foot in India at any time in his life, James Mill took upon himself the task of writing the monumental <i>History of British India</i>, a classic of colonial self-congratulation which contains a complete denunciation and rejection of Indian culture and civilisation and which both exhorts and extolls the civilizing mission of the British in the subcontinent. He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British, a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies, but which is seen in recent decades as being deeply problematic.

Standard histories of philosophy make him the midpoint in the development of German idealism, situating him between Johann Gottlieb Fichte, his mentor in his early years, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, his former university roommate, early friend, and later rival. Interpreting Schelling\'s philosophy is regarded as difficult because of its evolving nature.
</p><p>Schelling\'s thought in the large has been neglected, especially in the English-speaking world, as has been his later work on mythology and revelation, much of which remains untranslated. An important factor was the ascendancy of Hegel, whose mature works portray Schelling as a mere footnote in the development of idealism. Schelling\'s <i>Naturphilosophie</i> also has been attacked by scientists for its analogizing tendency and lack of empirical orientation. However, some later philosophers have shown interest in re-examining Schelling\'s body of work.

<p><b>Arthur Schopenhauer</b> (<span></span> <i title="English pronunciation respelling">SHOH-pən-how-ər</i>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈʔaɐ̯tʊɐ̯ ˈʃoːpm̩ˌhaʊ̯ɐ]</span>; 22 February 1788 – 21 September 1860) was a German philosopher. He is best known for his 1818 work <i>The World as Will and Representation</i> (expanded in 1844), wherein he characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of a blind and insatiable metaphysical will. Proceeding from the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant, Schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism, rejecting the contemporaneous post-Kantian philosophies of German idealism. Schopenhauer was among the first thinkers in Western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of Eastern philosophy (e.g., asceticism, the world-as-appearance), having initially arrived at similar conclusions as the result of his own philosophical work.</p><p>Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his life, Schopenhauer has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science. His writing on aesthetics, morality, and psychology influenced thinkers and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Those who cited his influence include Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner, Leo Tolstoy, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Schrödinger, Otto Rank, Gustav Mahler, Joseph Campbell, Albert Einstein, Carl Jung, Thomas Mann, Émile Zola, George Bernard Shaw, Jorge Luis Borges and Samuel Beckett.</p>',

<p><b>William Whewell</b>  (<span></span> <i title="English pronunciation respelling"><span>HEW</span>-əl</i>; 24 May 1794 – 6 March 1866) was an English polymath, scientist, Anglican priest, philosopher, theologian, and historian of science. He was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.  In his time as a student there, he achieved distinction in both poetry and mathematics.
</p><p>What is most often remarked about Whewell is the breadth of his endeavours.  In a time of increasing specialisation, Whewell appears as a vestige of an earlier era when natural philosophers dabbled in a bit of everything. He researched ocean tides (for which he won the Royal Medal), published work in the disciplines of mechanics, physics, geology, astronomy, and economics, while also finding the time to compose poetry, author a Bridgewater Treatise, translate the works of Goethe, and write sermons and theological tracts.  In mathematics, Whewell introduced what is now called the Whewell equation, an equation defining the shape of a curve without reference to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system.
</p><p>One of Whewell\'s greatest gifts to science was his wordsmithing.  He often corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with new terms for their discoveries.  Whewell contributed the terms scientist, physicist, linguistics, consilience, catastrophism, uniformitarianism, and astigmatism amongst others; Whewell suggested the terms electrode, ion, dielectric, anode, and cathode to Michael Faraday.</p><p>Whewell died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse.

He is sometimes regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.</p><p>Influenced by the utopian socialist Henri Saint-Simon, Comte developed the <i>positive philosophy</i> in an attempt to remedy the social malaise of the French Revolution, calling for a new social doctrine based on the sciences. Comte was a major influence on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, and George Eliot. His concept of <i>sociologie</i> and  social evolutionism set the tone for early social theorists and anthropologists such as Harriet Martineau and Herbert Spencer, evolving into modern academic sociology presented by Émile Durkheim as practical and objective social research.
</p><p>Comte\'s social theories culminated in his "Religion of Humanity", which presaged the development of non-theistic religious humanist and secular humanist organizations in the 19th century. Comte may have coined the word <i>altruisme</i> (altruism).</p>

            'description' => '<p><b>Ralph Waldo Emerson</b> (May 25, 1803 – April 27, 1882) was an American essayist, lecturer, philosopher, and poet who led the transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States.
</p><p>Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of transcendentalism in his 1836 essay "Nature". Following this work, he gave a speech entitled "The American Scholar" in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. considered to be America\'s "intellectual Declaration of Independence."</p><p>Emerson wrote most of his important essays as lectures first and then revised them for print. His first two collections of essays, <i>Essays: First Series</i> (1841) and <i>Essays: Second Series</i> (1844), represent the core of his thinking. They include the well-known essays "Self-Reliance", "The Over-Soul", "Circles", "The Poet", and "Experience." Together with "Nature", these essays made the decade from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s Emerson\'s most fertile period. Emerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical tenets, but developing certain ideas such as individuality, freedom, the ability for mankind to realize almost anything, and the relationship between the soul and the surrounding world. Emerson\'s "nature" was more philosophical than naturalistic: "Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul." Emerson is one of several figures who "took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world."</p><p>He remains among the linchpins of the American romantic movement, and his work has greatly influenced the thinkers, writers and poets that followed him. When asked to sum up his work, he said his central doctrine was "the infinitude of the private man." Emerson is also well known as a mentor and friend of Henry David Thoreau, a fellow transcendentalist.</p>',

<p><b>Alexis Charles Henri Clérel, Viscount de Tocqueville</b> (<span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[alɛgzi də tɔkvil]</span>; 29 July 1805 – 16 April 1859) was a French diplomat, political scientist and historian. He was best known for his works <i>Democracy in America</i> (appearing in two volumes, 1835 and 1840) and <i>The Old Regime and the Revolution</i> (1856). In both, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. <i>Democracy in America</i> was published after Tocqueville\'s travels in the United States and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science.
</p><p>Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830–1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849–1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoléon Bonaparte\'s 2 December 1851 coup and thereafter began work on <i>The Old Regime and the Revolution.</i></p><p>He argued the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but he was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.</p>',

Stirner\'s main work is <i>The Ego and Its Own</i>, also known as <i>The Ego and His Own</i> (<i>Der Einzige und sein Eigentum</i> in German, which translates literally as <i>The Individual and His Property</i>). This work was first published in 1845 in Leipzig and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.

<p><b>John Stuart Mill</b> (20 May 1806 – 8 May 1873), usually cited as <b>J. S. Mill</b>, was a British philosopher, political economist, and civil servant. One of the most influential thinkers in the history of liberalism, he contributed widely to social theory, political theory, and political economy. Dubbed "the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century", Mill\'s conception of liberty justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control.</p><p>Mill was a proponent of utilitarianism, an ethical theory developed by his predecessor Jeremy Bentham. He contributed to the investigation of scientific methodology, though his knowledge of the topic was based on the writings of others, notably William Whewell, John Herschel, and Auguste Comte, and research carried out for Mill by Alexander Bain. Mill engaged in written debate with Whewell.</p><p>A member of the Liberal Party, he was also the first Member of Parliament to call for women\'s suffrage.</p>',

He was the first person to declare himself an anarchist, using that term and is widely regarded as one of the ideology\'s most influential theorists. Proudhon is even considered by many to be the "father of anarchism". He became a member of the French Parliament after the Revolution of 1848, whereafter he referred to himself as a federalist.</p><p>Proudhon, who was born in Besançon, was a printer who taught himself Latin in order to better print books in the language. His best-known assertion is that "property is theft!", contained in his first major work, <i>What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government</i> (<i>Qu\'est-ce que la propriété? Recherche sur le principe du droit et du gouvernement</i>), published in 1840. The book\'s publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of Karl Marx, who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each other and they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon\'s <i>The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty</i> with the provocatively titled <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and Marxist wings of the International Working Men\'s Association. Some such as Edmund Wilson have contended that Marx\'s attack on Proudhon had its origin in the latter\'s defense of Karl Grün, whom Marx bitterly disliked, but who had been preparing translations of Proudhon\'s work.
</p><p>Proudhon favored workers\' associations or co-operatives as well as individual worker/peasant possession over private ownership or the nationalization of land and workplaces. He considered social revolution to be achievable in a peaceful manner. In <i>The Confessions of a Revolutionary</i>, Proudhon asserted that "Anarchy is Order Without Power", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist circled-A symbol, today "one of the most common graffiti on the urban landscape". He unsuccessfully tried to create a national bank, to be funded by what became an abortive attempt at an income tax on capitalists and shareholders. Similar in some respects to a credit union, it would have given interest-free loans.</p>',

<p><b>Charles Robert Darwin</b>,  (<span></span>; 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors and, in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.</p><p>Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin\'s scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.</p><p>Darwin\'s early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. Studies at the University of Cambridge (Christ\'s College) encouraged his passion for natural science. His five-year voyage on HMS <i>Beagle</i> established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell\'s uniformitarian ideas, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author.</p><p>Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin\'s work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in <i>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</i>, followed by <i>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</i> (1872). His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, <i>The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms</i> (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.</p><p>Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.</p>

She was the first full-time American female book reviewer in journalism. Her book <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i> is considered the first major feminist work in the United States.
</p><p>Born Sarah Margaret Fuller in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she was given a substantial early education by her father, Timothy Fuller. She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing what she called "conversations": discussions among women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education. She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal <i>The Dial</i> in 1840, before joining the staff of the <i>New York Tribune</i> under Horace Greeley in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the best-read person in New England, male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at Harvard College. Her seminal work, <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i>, was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the <i>Tribune</i> as its first female correspondent. She soon became involved with the revolutions in Italy and allied herself with Giuseppe Mazzini. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off Fire Island, New York, as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller\'s body was never recovered.
</p><p>Fuller was an advocate of women\'s rights and, in particular, women\'s education and the right to employment. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including prison reform and the emancipation of slaves in the United States. Many other advocates for women\'s rights and feminism, including Susan B. Anthony, cite Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend Harriet Martineau.  She said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller\'s death, her importance faded; the editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication.

<p><b>Søren Aabye Kierkegaard</b> (<span></span> <i title="English pronunciation respelling"><span>SORR</span>-ən <span>KEER</span>-kə-gard</i>; <small>Danish: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[sɶːɐn ˈkiɐ̯ɡəɡɒːˀ]</span><small class="nowrap"> (<span><span><span> </span>listen</span></span>)</small>; 5 May 1813 – 11 November 1855) was a Danish philosopher, theologian, poet, social critic and religious author who is widely considered to be the first existentialist philosopher. He wrote critical texts on organized religion, Christendom, morality, ethics, psychology, and the philosophy of religion, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony and parables. Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as a "single individual", giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment. He was against literary critics who defined idealist intellectuals and philosophers of his time, and thought that Swedenborg, Hegel, Goethe, Fichte, Schelling, Schlegel and Hans Christian Andersen were all "understood" far too quickly by "scholars".</p><p>Kierkegaard\'s theological work focuses on Christian ethics, the institution of the Church, the differences between purely objective proofs of Christianity, the infinite qualitative distinction between man and God, and the individual\'s subjective relationship to the God-Man Jesus the Christ, which came through faith. Much of his work deals with Christian love. He was extremely critical of the practice of Christianity as a state religion, primarily that of the Church of Denmark. His psychological work explored the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices.</p><p>Kierkegaard\'s early work was written under the various pseudonyms that he used to present distinctive viewpoints and to interact with each other in complex dialogue. He explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints, each under a different pseudonym. He wrote many <i>Upbuilding Discourses</i> under his own name and dedicated them to the "single individual" who might want to discover the meaning of his works. Notably, he wrote: "Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject." While scientists can learn about the world by observation, Kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation could reveal the inner workings of the world of the spirit.</p><p>Some of Kierkegaard\'s key ideas include the concept of "subjective and objective truths", the knight of faith, the recollection and repetition dichotomy, angst, the infinite qualitative distinction, faith as a passion, and the three stages on life\'s way. Kierkegaard wrote in Danish and the reception of his work was initially limited to Scandinavia, but by the turn of the 20th century his writings were translated into French, German, and other major European languages. By the mid-20th century, his thought exerted a substantial influence on philosophy, theology, and Western culture.</p>',

<p><b>Henry David Thoreau</b> (see name pronunciation; July 12, 1817 – May 6, 1862) was an American essayist, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, and historian. A leading transcendentalist, Thoreau is best known for his book <i>Walden</i>, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay "Civil Disobedience" (originally published as "Resistance to Civil Government"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.
</p><p>Thoreau\'s books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and Yankee attention to practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life\'s true essential needs.</p><p>He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending the abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau\'s philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist. Though "Civil Disobedience" seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—"I ask for, not at once no government, but <i>at once</i> a better government"—the direction of this improvement contrarily points toward anarchism: "\'That government is best which governs not at all;\' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."</p>',

<p><b>Sojourner Truth</b> (<span></span>; born <b>Isabella </b> (<b>Belle</b>) <b>Baumfree</b>; <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span> 1797</span> – November 26, 1883) was an African-American abolitionist and women\'s rights activist. Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, Ulster County, New York, but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826. After going to court to recover her son, in 1828 she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man.
</p><p>She gave herself the name Sojourner Truth in 1843 after she became convinced that God had called her to leave the city and go into the countryside "testifying the hope that was in her". Her best-known speech was delivered extemporaneously, in 1851, at the Ohio Women\'s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. The speech became widely known during the Civil War by the title "Ain\'t I a Woman?," a variation of the original speech re-written by someone else using a stereotypical Southern dialect; whereas Sojourner Truth was from New York and grew up speaking Dutch as her first language. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for former slaves.
</p><p>In 2014, Truth was included in <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine\'s list of the "100 Most Significant Americans of All Time".</p>',

<p><b>Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin</b> (<span></span>; 30 May [O.S. 18 May] 1814 – 1 July 1876) was a Russian revolutionary anarchist and founder of collectivist anarchism. He is considered among the most influential figures of anarchism and one of the principal founders of the social anarchist tradition. Bakunin\'s enormous prestige as an activist made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, and he gained substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.
</p><p>Bakunin grew up in Pryamukhino, a family estate in Tver Governorate, where he moved to study philosophy and began to read the French encyclopédistes, leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of Fichte. From Fichte, Bakunin went on to immerse himself in the works of Hegel, the most influential thinker among German intellectuals at the time. That led to his embrace of Hegelianism, bedazzled by Hegel\'s famous maxim: "Everything that exists is rational". In 1840, Bakunin traveled to Saint Petersburg and Berlin with the intention of preparing himself for a professorship in philosophy or history at the University of Moscow. In 1842, Bakunin moved from Berlin to Dresden. Eventually he arrived in Paris, where he met Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Karl Marx.
</p><p>Bakunin\'s increasing radicalism—including staunch opposition to imperialism in east and central Europe by Russia and other powers—changed his life, putting an end to hopes of a professorial career. He was eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia\'s oppression of Poland. In 1849, Bakunin was apprehended in Dresden for his participation in the Czech rebellion of 1848 and turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in the Peter-Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg. He remained there until 1857, when he was exiled to a work camp in Siberia. Escaping to Japan, the United States and finally ending up in London for a short time, he worked with Alexander Herzen on the journal <i>Kolokol</i> (<i>The Bell</i>). In 1863, he left to join the insurrection in Poland, but he failed to reach his destination and instead spent some time in Switzerland and Italy.
</p><p>In 1868, Bakunin joined the socialist International Working Men\'s Association, a federation of trade unions and workers\' organizations, which had sections in many European countries as well as in Latin America and (after 1872) in North Africa and the Middle East. The Bakuninist or anarchist trend rapidly expanded in influence, especially in Spain, which constituted the largest section of the International at the time. A showdown loomed with Marx, who was a key figure in the General Council of the International. The 1872 Hague Congress was dominated by a struggle between Marx and his followers, who argued for the use of the state to bring about socialism; and the Bakunin/anarchist faction, which argued instead for the replacement of the state by federations of self-governing workplaces and communes. Bakunin could not attend the congress as he could not reach the Netherlands. Bakunin\'s faction present at the conference lost and Bakunin was (in Marx\'s view) expelled for supposedly maintaining a secret organisation within the international.
</p><p>However, the anarchists insisted the congress was unrepresentative and exceeded its powers; and they held a rival conference of the International at Saint-Imier in Switzerland in 1872. This repudiated the Hague meeting, including Bakunin\'s supposed expulsion. The great majority of sections of the International affiliated to the St. Imier body, making Marx\'s victory rather more illusory than pro-Marxist accounts suggest. The far larger Bakuninist international outlasted its small Marxist rival which was isolated in New York, and it also greatly facilitated the global spread of anarcho-socialism. In the International as well as in his writings, Bakunin articulated the basic ideas of syndicalism and of anarchism as he developed the basic anarchist analysis and strategy. He had by this stage abandoned the anti-imperialist nationalism of his youth.
</p><p>From 1870 to 1876, Bakunin wrote some of his longer works, such as <i>Statism and Anarchy</i> and <i>God and the State</i>. However, Bakunin remained a direct participant in struggles. In 1870, he was involved in an insurrection in Lyon, France, which foreshadowed the Paris Commune. The Paris Commune closely corresponded to many elements of Bakunin\'s anarchist programme—self-management, mandates delegates, a militia system with elected officers and decentralisation. Anarchists like Élisée Reclus and those in the tradition of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon—who had greatly influenced Bakunin—were key figures in the Commune. Despite declining health, much a result of his years of imprisonment, Bakunin also sought to take part in a communal insurrection involving anarchists in Bologna, Italy, but was forced to return to Switzerland in disguise, where he settled in Lugano. He remained active in the workers\' and peasants\' movements of Europe and was also a major influence on movements in Egypt and Latin America.

<p><b>Elizabeth Cady Stanton</b> (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women\'s rights movement. Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the Seneca Falls Convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women\'s rights and women\'s suffrage movements in the United States. Stanton was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association from 1892 until 1900.
</p><p>Before Stanton narrowed her political focus almost exclusively to women\'s rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many of those involved in the women\'s rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women\'s parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.
</p><p>After the American Civil War, Stanton\'s commitment to female suffrage caused a schism in the women\'s rights movement when she, together with Susan B. Anthony, declined to support passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African American men while women, black and white, were denied those same rights. Her position on this issue, together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women\'s issues beyond voting rights, led to the formation of two separate women\'s rights organizations that were finally rejoined, with Stanton as president of the joint organization, about twenty years after her break from the original women\'s suffrage movement.
</p><p>Stanton died in 1902, having written both <i>The Woman\'s Bible</i> and her autobiography <i>Eighty Years and More</i>, and many other articles and pamphlets about female suffrage and women\'s rights.

<p><b>Karl Marx</b> (<small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈkaɐ̯l ˈmaɐ̯ks]</span>; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary.
</p><p>Born in Trier, Germany, to a Jewish middle-class family, Marx studied law and philosophy at university. Due to his political publications, Marx became stateless and lived in exile in London for decades, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and publish his writings, researching in the reading room of the British Museum. His best-known titles are the 1848 pamphlet, <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, and the three-volume <i>Das Kapital</i>. His political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual, economic and political history and his name has been used as an adjective, a noun and a school of social theory.
</p><p>Marx\'s theories about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class\' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.</p><p>Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and criticised. His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital, and subsequent economic thought. Many intellectuals, labour unions, artists and political parties worldwide have been influenced by Marx\'s work, with many modifying or adapting his ideas. Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.</p>',

<p><b>Friedrich Engels</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈʔɛŋl̩s]</span>; sometimes anglicised <b>Frederick Engels</b>; 28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German philosopher, communist, social scientist, journalist and businessman. His father was an owner of a large textile factory in Salford, England.
</p><p>Engels founded Marxist theory together with Karl Marx and in 1845 published <i>The Condition of the Working Class in England</i>, based on personal observations and research in Manchester. In 1848, Engels co-authored <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> with Marx and also authored and co-authored (primarily with Marx) many other works. Later, Engels supported Marx financially to do research and write <i>Das Kapital</i>. After Marx\'s death, Engels edited the second and third volumes. Additionally, Engels organised Marx\'s notes on the <i>Theories of Surplus Value</i>, which he later published as the "fourth volume" of <i>Capital</i>.</p><p>Engels died in London on 5 August 1895, at the age of 74 and following cremation his ashes were scattered off Beachy Head, near Eastbourne.

</p>
<p><b>Herbert Spencer</b> (27 April 1820 – 8 December 1903) was an English philosopher, biologist, anthropologist, sociologist, and prominent classical liberal political theorist of the Victorian era.
</p><p>Spencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, anthropology, economics, political theory, philosophy, literature, astronomy, biology, sociology, and psychology. During his lifetime he achieved tremendous authority, mainly in English-speaking academia. "The only other English philosopher to have achieved anything like such widespread popularity was Bertrand Russell, and that was in the 20th century." Spencer was "the single most famous European intellectual in the closing decades of the nineteenth century" but his influence declined sharply after 1900: "Who now reads Spencer?" asked Talcott Parsons in 1937.</p><p>Spencer is best known for the expression "survival of the fittest", which he coined in <i>Principles of Biology</i> (1864), after reading Charles Darwin\'s <i>On the Origin of Species</i>. This term strongly suggests natural selection, yet as Spencer extended evolution into realms of sociology and ethics, he also made use of Lamarckism.</p>

<p><b>Susan B. Anthony</b> (February 15, 1820 – March 13, 1906) was an American social reformer and women\'s rights activist who played a pivotal role in the women\'s suffrage movement. Born into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slavery petitions at the age of 17. In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society.
</p><p>In 1851, she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who became her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities, primarily in the field of women\'s rights. In 1852, they founded the New York Women\'s State Temperance Society after Anthony was prevented from speaking at a temperance conference because she was female. In 1863, they founded the Women\'s Loyal National League, which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery. In 1866, they initiated the American Equal Rights Association, which campaigned for equal rights for both women and African Americans. In 1868, they began publishing a women\'s rights newspaper called <i>The Revolution</i>. In 1869, they founded the National Woman Suffrage Association as part of a split in the women\'s movement. In 1890, the split was formally healed when their organization merged with the rival American Woman Suffrage Association to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association, with Anthony as its key force. In 1876, Anthony and Stanton began working with Matilda Joslyn Gage on what eventually grew into the six-volume <i>History of Woman Suffrage</i>. The interests of Anthony and Stanton diverged somewhat in later years, but the two remained close friends.
</p><p>In 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action. In 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote. Introduced by Sen. Aaron A. Sargent (R-CA), it later became known colloquially as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.  It was ratified as the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.
</p><p>Anthony traveled extensively in support of women\'s suffrage, giving as many as 75 to 100 speeches per year and working on many state campaigns. She worked internationally for women\'s rights, playing a key role in creating the International Council of Women, which is still active. She also helped to bring about the World\'s Congress of Representative Women at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.
</p><p>When she first began campaigning for women\'s rights, Anthony was harshly ridiculed and accused of trying to destroy the institution of marriage. Public perception of her changed radically during her lifetime, however. Her 80th birthday was celebrated in the White House at the invitation of President William McKinley. She became the first actual woman to be depicted on U.S. coinage when her portrait appeared on the 1979 dollar coin.

W. F. Hegel\'s Chair in Philosophy at the University of Berlin.  As a polymathic philosopher, working in a modern research university, Dilthey\'s research interests revolved around questions of scientific methodology, historical evidence and history\'s status as a science.  He could be considered an empiricist, in contrast to the idealism prevalent in Germany at the time, but his account of what constitutes the empirical and experiential differs from British empiricism and positivism in its central epistemological and ontological assumptions, which are drawn from German literary and philosophical traditions.

            'description' => '<p><b>Charles Sanders Peirce</b> (<span></span> "purse"; 10 September 1839 – 19 April 1914) was an American philosopher, logician, mathematician, and scientist who is sometimes known as "the father of pragmatism". He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, and semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism.
</p><p>An innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself,  first and foremost, a logician. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th century Western philosophy; additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits; the same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.</p><p>In 1934, the philosopher Paul Weiss called Peirce "the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America\'s greatest logician." <i>Webster\'s Biographical Dictionary</i> said in 1943 that Peirce was "now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time." Keith Devlin similarly referred to Peirce as one of the greatest philosophers ever.</p>',

James was a leading thinker of the late nineteenth century, one of the most influential U.S. philosophers, and has been labelled the "Father of American psychology".</p><p>Along with Charles Sanders Peirce, James established the philosophical school known as pragmatism, and is also cited as one of the founders of functional psychology. A <i>Review of General Psychology</i> analysis, published in 2002, ranked James as the 14th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century. A survey published in <i>American Psychologist</i> in 1991 ranked James\'s reputation in second place, after Wilhelm Wundt, who is widely regarded as the founder of experimental psychology. James also developed the philosophical perspective known as radical empiricism. James\' work has influenced intellectuals such as Émile Durkheim, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty, and has even influenced Presidents, such as Jimmy Carter.
</p><p>Born into a wealthy family, James was the son of the Swedenborgian theologian Henry James Sr. and the brother of both the prominent novelist Henry James and the diarist Alice James. James trained as a physician and taught anatomy at Harvard, but never practiced medicine. Instead he pursued his interests in psychology and then philosophy. James wrote widely on many topics, including epistemology, education, metaphysics, psychology, religion, and mysticism. Among his most influential books are <i>The Principles of Psychology</i>, which was a groundbreaking text in the field of psychology; <i>Essays in Radical Empiricism</i>, an important text in philosophy; and <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, which investigated different forms of religious experience, including theories on mind-cure.</p>',

<p><b>Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin</b> (<span></span>; Russian: <span lang="ru">Пётр Алексе́евич Кропо́ткин</span>; December 9, 1842 – February 8, 1921) was a Russian activist, revolutionary, scientist, geographer and philosopher who advocated anarcho-communism.
</p><p>Born into an aristocratic land-owning family, he attended a military school and later served as an officer in Siberia, where he participated in several geological expeditions. He was imprisoned for his activism in 1874 and managed to escape two years later. He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost four years) and in England. He returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution in 1917, but was disappointed by the Bolshevik form of state socialism.
</p><p>Kropotkin was a proponent of a decentralised communist society free from central government and based on voluntary associations of self-governing communities and worker-run enterprises. He wrote many books, pamphlets and articles, the most prominent being <i>The Conquest of Bread</i> and <i>Fields, Factories and Workshops</i>; and his principal scientific offering, <i>Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution</i>. He also contributed the article on anarchism to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition</i> and left unfinished a work on anarchist ethical philosophy.

<p><b>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːtʃə]</span><small class="nowrap"> (<span><span><span> </span>listen</span></span>)</small> <small>or</small> <small></small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[- ˈniːtsʃə]</span>; 15 October 1844 – 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, philologist, and a Latin and Greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on Western philosophy and modern intellectual history. He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24. Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889 at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward, a complete loss of his mental faculties. He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche. Nietzsche died in 1900.</p><p>Nietzsche\'s body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, religion, tragedy, culture and science. His early inspiration was drawn from figures such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. His writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. Prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; his genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality and his related theory of master–slave morality; his aesthetic affirmation of existence in response to the "death of God" and the profound crisis of nihilism; his notion of the Apollonian and Dionysian; and his characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. He also developed influential concepts such as the <i><i lang="de" title="German language text">Übermensch</i></i> and the doctrine of eternal return. In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural and moral contexts in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health.</p><p>After his death, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche became the curator and editor of her brother\'s manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche\'s unpublished writings to fit her own German nationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche\'s stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. Through her published editions, Nietzsche\'s work became associated with fascism and Nazism; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available. Nietzsche\'s thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of continental philosophy such as existentialism, postmodernism and post-structuralism—as well as art, literature, psychology, politics and popular culture.</p>',

<p><b>William Kingdon Clifford</b> FRS (4 May 1845 – 3 March 1879) was an English mathematician and philosopher. Building on the work of Hermann Grassmann, he introduced what is now termed geometric algebra, a special case of the Clifford algebra named in his honour. The operations of geometric algebra have the effect of mirroring, rotating, translating, and mapping the geometric objects that are being modelled to new positions. Clifford algebras in general and geometric algebra in particular have been of ever increasing importance to mathematical physics, geometry, and computing. Clifford was the first to suggest that gravitation might be a manifestation of an underlying geometry. In his philosophical writings he coined the expression "mind-stuff".

<p><b>Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto</b> (<span></span>; <small>Italian: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[vilˈfreːdo paˈreːto]</span>; born <b>Wilfried Fritz Pareto</b>, 15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923) was an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher. He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of income distribution and in the analysis of individuals\' choices.  He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term "elite" in social analysis.
</p><p>He introduced the concept of Pareto efficiency and helped develop the field of microeconomics. He was also the first to discover that income follows a Pareto distribution, which is a power law probability distribution. The Pareto principle was named after him, and it was built on observations of his such as that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by about 20% of the population. He also contributed to the fields of sociology and mathematics, according to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard L. Hudson:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>His legacy as an economist was profound. Partly because of him, the field evolved from a branch of moral philosophy as practised by Adam Smith into a data intensive field of scientific research and mathematical equations.  His books look more like modern economics than most other texts of that day: tables of statistics from across the world and ages, rows of integral signs and equations, intricate charts and graphs.</p></blockquote>',

<p><b>Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈɡɔtloːp ˈfreːɡə]</span>; 8 November 1848 – 26 July 1925) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician.  He is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers.
</p><p>His contributions include the development of modern logic in the <i>Begriffsschrift</i> and work in the foundations of mathematics.  His book the <i>Foundations of Arithmetic</i> is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn.  His philosophical papers "On Sense and Reference" ("Über Sinn und Bedeutung") and "The Thought" ("Der Gedanke") are widely cited.

<p><b>Jules Henri Poincaré</b> (<span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɑ̃ʁi pwɛ̃kaʁe]</span><small class="nowrap"> (<span><span><span> </span>listen</span></span>)</small>; 29 April 1854 – 17 July 1912) was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and philosopher of science. He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as "The Last Universalist," since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime.
</p><p>As a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics. He was responsible for formulating the Poincaré conjecture, which was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics until it was solved in 2002–2003 by Grigori Perelman. In his research on the three-body problem, Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology.
</p><p>Poincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell\'s equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (<i>ondes gravifiques</i>) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.
</p><p>The Poincaré group used in physics and mathematics was named after him.

His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both linguistics and semiology in the 20th century. He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics and one of two major founders (together with Charles Sanders Peirce) of semiotics/semiology.</p><p>One of his translators, Roy Harris, summarized Saussure\'s contribution to linguistics and the study of "the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology and anthropology." Although they have undergone extension and critique over time, the dimensions of organization introduced by Saussure continue to inform contemporary approaches to the phenomenon of language. Prague school linguist Jan Mukařovský writes that Saussure\'s "discovery of the internal structure of the linguistic sign differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic \'things\'... and from mental processes", and that in this development "new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature". Ruqaiya Hasan argues that "the impact of Saussure’s theory of the linguistic sign has been such that modern linguists and their theories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-Saussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure".</p>',

<p><b>David Émile Durkheim</b> (<small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[emil dyʁkɛm]</span> <small>or</small> <small></small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[dyʁkajm]</span>; 15 April 1858 – 15 November  1917) was a French sociologist. He formally established the academic discipline and—with W. E. B. Du Bois, Karl Marx and Max Weber—is commonly cited as the principal architect of modern social science.</p><p>Much of Durkheim\'s work was concerned with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity, an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social institutions have come into being. His first major sociological work was <i>The Division of Labour in Society</i> (1893). In 1895, he published <i>The Rules of Sociological Method</i> and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France\'s first professor of sociology. In 1898, he established the journal <i>L\'Année Sociologique</i>. Durkheim\'s seminal monograph, <i>Suicide</i> (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. <i>The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</i> (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.
</p><p>Durkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate science. He refined the positivism originally set forth by Auguste Comte, promoting what could be considered as a form of epistemological realism, as well as the use of the hypothetico-deductive model in social science. For him, sociology was the science of institutions, if this term is understood in its broader meaning as "beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity" and its aim being to discover structural social facts. Durkheim was a major proponent of structural functionalism, a foundational perspective in both sociology and anthropology. In his view, social science should be purely holistic; that is, sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals.
</p><p>He remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and published works on a variety of topics, including the sociology of knowledge, morality, social stratification, religion, law, education, and deviance. Durkheimian terms such as "collective consciousness" have since entered the popular lexicon.</p>',

<p><b>Giuseppe Peano</b> (<span></span>; <small>Italian: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[dʒuˈzɛppe peˈaːno]</span>; 27 August 1858 – 20 April 1932) was an Italian mathematician and glottologist. The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, to which he contributed much notation. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction. He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the University of Turin.
He also wrote an international auxiliary language, Latino sine flexione ("Latin without inflections"), which is a simplified version of Classical Latin. Most of his books and papers are in Latin sine flexione, others are in Italian.

<p><b>Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈʔɛtmʊnt ˈhʊsɐl]</span>; 8 April 1859 – 27 April 1938) was a German philosopher who established the school of phenomenology. In his early work, he elaborated critiques of historicism and of psychologism in logic based on analyses of intentionality. In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called phenomenological reduction. Arguing that transcendental consciousness sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl re-defined phenomenology as a transcendental-idealist philosophy. Husserl\'s thought profoundly influenced the landscape of twentieth-century philosophy, and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond.
</p><p>Husserl studied mathematics under the tutelage of Karl Weierstrass and Leo Königsberger, and philosophy under Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. He taught philosophy as a <i>Privatdozent</i> at Halle from 1887, then as professor, first at Göttingen from 1901, then at Freiburg from 1916 until he retired in 1928, after which he remained highly productive. Following an illness, he died in Freiburg in 1938.</p>',

Dewey is one of the primary figures associated with the philosophy of pragmatism and is considered one of the fathers of functional psychology. A <i>Review of General Psychology</i> survey, published in 2002, ranked Dewey as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century. A well-known public intellectual, he was also a major voice of progressive education and liberalism. Although Dewey is known best for his publications about education, he also wrote about many other topics, including epistemology, metaphysics, aesthetics, art, logic, social theory, and ethics. He was a major educational reformer for the 20th century.
</p><p>The overriding theme of Dewey\'s works was his profound belief in democracy, be it in politics, education, or communication and journalism. As Dewey himself stated in 1888, while still at the University of Michigan, "Democracy and the one, ultimate, ethical ideal of humanity are to my mind synonymous."</p><p>Known for his advocacy of democracy, Dewey considered two fundamental elements—schools and civil society—to be major topics needing attention and reconstruction to encourage experimental intelligence and plurality. Dewey asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists a fully formed public opinion, accomplished by communication among citizens, experts, and politicians, with the latter being accountable for the policies they adopt.

She co-founded, with Ellen Gates Starr, an early settlement house in the United States, Chicago\'s Hull House that would later become known as one of the most famous settlement houses in America. In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era. She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace. In her essay "Utilization of Women in City Government," Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women\'s roles in the private sphere. Thus, these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men, so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions. She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities. She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy, and is known by many as the first woman "public philosopher in the history of the United States". In 1889 she co-founded Hull House, and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the ACLU. In 1931 she became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and is recognized as the founder of the social work profession in the United States.</p>',

</p><p>Groos was Full Professor of philosophy in Gießen, Basel and 1911-1929 in Tübingen.
</p><p>His main idea was that play is basically useful, and so it can be explained by the normal process of evolution by natural selection. When animals \'play\' they are practising basic instincts, such as fighting, for survival. This is translated from the original as "pre-tuning". Despite this insight, Groos\' work is seldom read today, and his connection of play with aesthetics is thought "misguided". Another area of study was the psychology of literature, including statistical analysis.

</p>
<p><b>Alfred North Whitehead</b>  (15 February 1861 – 30 December 1947) was an Anglo-American mathematician and philosopher.  He is best known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as process philosophy, which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology, among other areas.
</p><p>In his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics. His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume <i>Principia Mathematica</i> (1910–13), which he wrote with former student Bertrand Russell. <i>Principia Mathematica</i> is considered one of the twentieth century\'s most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library.</p><p>Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.  Today Whitehead\'s philosophical works – particularly <i>Process and Reality</i> – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.
</p><p>Whitehead\'s process philosophy argues that "there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us." For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whitehead\'s thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization and environmental ethics pioneered by John B. Cobb, Jr.</p>',

<p><b>Maximilian Karl Emil Weber</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈveːbɐ]</span>; 21 April 1864 – 14 June 1920) was a German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist. His ideas profoundly influenced social theory and social research. Weber is often cited, with Émile Durkheim and Karl Marx, as among the three founders of sociology. Weber was a key proponent of methodological anti-positivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive (rather than purely empiricist) means, based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to their own actions. Unlike Durkheim, he did not believe in mono-causality and rather proposed that for any outcome there can be multiple causes.</p><p>Weber\'s main intellectual concern was understanding the processes of rationalisation, secularisation, and "disenchantment" that he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity. He saw these as the result of a new way of thinking about the world. Weber is best known for his thesis combining economic sociology and the sociology of religion, elaborated in his book <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, in which he proposed that ascetic Protestantism was one of the major "elective affinities" associated with the rise in the Western world of market-driven capitalism and the rational-legal nation-state. He argued that it was in the basic tenets of Protestantism to boost capitalism. Thus, it can be said that the spirit of capitalism is inherent to Protestant religious values.
</p><p>Against Marx\'s historical materialism, Weber emphasised the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism. The <i>Protestant Ethic</i> formed the earliest part in Weber\'s broader investigations into world religion; he went on to examine the religions of China, the religions of India and ancient Judaism, with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of social stratification. In another major work, "Politics as a Vocation", Weber defined the state as an entity that successfully claims a "monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory".  He was also the first to categorise social authority into distinct forms, which he labelled as charismatic, traditional, and rational-legal. His analysis of bureaucracy emphasised that modern state institutions are increasingly based on rational-legal authority.
</p><p>Weber also made a variety of other contributions in economic history, as well as economic theory and methodology. Weber\'s analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the critical theory associated with the Frankfurt School. After the First World War, Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919. After contracting Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in 1920, aged 56.</p>',

<p><b>Emma Goldman</b> (June 27 [O.S. June 15], 1869 – May 14, 1940) was an anarchist political activist and writer. She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century.
</p><p>Born in Kovno, Russian Empire (now Kaunas, Lithuania) to a Jewish family, Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women\'s rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892 and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for "inciting to riot" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal <i>Mother Earth</i>.
</p><p>In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to "induce persons not to register" for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with 248 others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country\'s October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion; she denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923, she published a book about her experiences, <i>My Disillusionment in Russia</i>. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called <i>Living My Life</i>. It was published in two volumes, in 1931 and 1935. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Goldman traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. She died in Toronto, Canada, on May 14, 1940, aged 70.
</p><p>During her life, Goldman was lionized as a freethinking "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women\'s suffrage, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman gained iconic status in the 1970s by a revival of interest in her life, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest.

<p><b>Rosa Luxemburg</b> (<small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈʁoːza ˈlʊksəmbʊʁk]</span><small class="nowrap"> (<span><span><span> </span>listen</span></span>)</small>; Polish: <i lang="pl">Róża Luksemburg</i>; also <i>Rozalia Luxenburg</i>; 5 March 1871 – 15 January 1919) was a Polish Marxist theorist, philosopher, economist, anti-war activist, and revolutionary socialist who became a naturalized German citizen at the age of 28. She was, successively, a member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).
</p><p>In 1915, after the SPD supported German involvement in World War I, she and Karl Liebknecht co-founded the anti-war Spartacus League (<i>Spartakusbund</i>), which eventually became the KPD. During the November Revolution she co-founded the newspaper <i>Die Rote Fahne</i> ("The Red Flag"), the central organ of the Spartacist movement.
</p><p>She considered the Spartacist uprising of January 1919 a blunder, but supported it as events unfolded. Friedrich Ebert\'s majority Social Democratic government crushed the revolt and the <i>Spartakusbund</i> by sending in the <i>Freikorps</i> (government-sponsored paramilitary groups consisting mostly of World War I veterans). <i>Freikorps</i> troops captured and summarily executed Luxemburg and Liebknecht during the rebellion. Luxemburg\'s body was thrown in the Landwehr Canal in Berlin.
</p><p>Due to her pointed criticism of both the Leninist and the more moderate social democratic schools of socialism, Luxemburg has had a somewhat ambivalent reception among scholars and theorists of the political left. Nonetheless, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were extensively idolized as communist martyrs by the East German communist regime. The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution notes that idolization of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht is an important tradition of German far-left extremism.</p>

<p><b>George Edward Moore</b>  (4 November 1873 – 24 October 1958) was an English philosopher. He was, with Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and (before them) Gottlob Frege, one of the founders of the analytic tradition in philosophy. Along with Russell, he led the turn away from idealism in British philosophy, and became well known for his advocacy of common sense concepts, his contributions to ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics, and "his exceptional personality and moral character". He was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge, highly influential among (though not a member of) the Bloomsbury Group, and the editor of the influential journal <i>Mind</i>. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1918. He was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, the intellectual secret society, from 1894 to 1901, and the Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club.

June 13, 1965) was an Austrian-born Israeli Jewish philosopher best known for his philosophy of dialogue, a form of existentialism centered on the distinction between the I–Thou relationship and the I–It relationship. Born in Vienna, Buber came from a family of observant Jews, but broke with Jewish custom to pursue secular studies in philosophy. In 1902, he became the editor of the weekly <i>Die Welt</i>, the central organ of the Zionist movement, although he later withdrew from organizational work in Zionism. In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, <i>Ich und Du</i> (later translated into English as <i>I and Thou</i>), and in 1925, he began translating the Hebrew Bible into the German language.

Originally from Spain, Santayana was raised and educated in the United States from the age of eight and identified himself as an American, although he always kept a valid Spanish passport. He wrote in English and is generally considered an American man of letters. At the age of forty-eight, Santayana left his position at Harvard and returned to Europe permanently, never to return to the United States.
</p><p>Santayana is popularly known for aphorisms, such as "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it", "Only the dead have seen the end of war", and the definition of beauty as "pleasure objectified". Although an atheist, he treasured the Spanish Catholic values, practices, and worldview in which he was raised. Santayana was a broad-ranging cultural critic spanning many disciplines.

<p><b>Harold Arthur Prichard</b> (1871–1947), usually cited as <b>H. A. Pritchard</b>, was an English philosopher. He was born in London in 1871, the eldest child of Walter Stennett Prichard (a solicitor) and his wife Lucy. Harold Prichard was a scholar of Clifton College from where he won a scholarship to New College, Oxford, to study mathematics. But after taking First Class honours in mathematical moderations (preliminary examinations) in 1891, he studied Greats (ancient history and philosophy) taking First Class Honours in 1894. He also played tennis for Oxford against Cambridge. On leaving Oxford he spent a brief period working for a firm of solicitors in London, before returning to Oxford where he spent the rest of his life, first as Fellow of Hertford College (1895–98) and then of Trinity College (1898–1924). He took early retirement from Trinity in 1924 on grounds of ill health, but recovered and was elected White\'s Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1928 and became a fellow of Corpus Christi College.  He retired in 1937.</p>',

<p><b>Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell</b>,  (<span></span>; 18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist, and Nobel laureate. At various points in his life, Russell considered himself a liberal, a socialist and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had "never been any of these things, in any profound sense". Russell was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom.</p><p>In the early 20th century, Russell led the British "revolt against idealism". He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, colleague G. E. Moore and protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century\'s premier logicians. With A. N. Whitehead he wrote <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics. His philosophical essay "On Denoting" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy". His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science (see type theory and type system) and philosophy, especially the philosophy of language, epistemology and metaphysics.
</p><p>Russell was a prominent anti-war activist and he championed anti-imperialism. Occasionally, he advocated preventive nuclear war, before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed and "welcomed with enthusiasm" world government. He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I. Later, Russell concluded that war against Adolf Hitler\'s Nazi Germany was a necessary "lesser of two evils" and criticized Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament. In 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature "in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought".</p>',

Trained within the Neo-Kantian Marburg School, he initially followed his mentor Hermann Cohen in attempting to supply an idealistic philosophy of science.
</p><p>After Cohen\'s death, Cassirer developed a theory of symbolism and used it to expand phenomenology of knowledge into a more general philosophy of culture. Cassirer was one of the leading 20th-century advocates of philosophical idealism. His most famous work is the <i>Philosophy of Symbolic Forms</i> (1923–1929).

Scheler developed further the philosophical method of the founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, and was called by José Ortega y Gasset "the first man of the philosophical paradise."  After his death in 1928, Martin Heidegger affirmed, with Ortega y Gasset, that all philosophers of the century were indebted to Scheler and praised him as "the strongest philosophical force in modern Germany, nay, in contemporary Europe and in contemporary philosophy as such."  In 1954, Karol Wojtyła, later Pope John Paul II, defended his doctoral thesis on "An Evaluation of the Possibility of Constructing a Christian Ethics on the Basis of the System of Max Scheler."

The self-styled "philosopher of Fascism", he was influential in providing an intellectual foundation for Italian Fascism, and ghostwrote part of <i>The Doctrine of Fascism</i> (1932) with Benito Mussolini. He was involved in the resurgence of Hegelian idealism in Italian philosophy and also devised his own system of thought, which he called "actual idealism" or "actualism", and which has been described as "the subjective extreme of the idealist tradition".</p>',

<p><b>Sir William David Ross</b> KBE FBA (15 April 1877 – 5 May 1971), known as <b>David Ross</b> but usually cited as <b>W. D. Ross</b>, was a Scottish philosopher who is known for his work in ethics. His best-known work is <i>The Right and the Good</i> (1930), and he is perhaps best known for developing a pluralist, deontological form of intuitionist ethics in response to G. E. Moore\'s intuitionism. Ross also critically edited and translated a number of Aristotle\'s works, in addition to writing on Greek philosophy.
</p><p>His accomplishments include his work with John Alexander Smith on a 12-volume translation of Aristotle.

</p><p>Although many of Teilhard\'s writings were censored by the Catholic Church during his lifetime because of his views on original sin, Teilhard has been posthumously praised by Pope Benedict XVI and other eminent Catholic figures, and his theological teachings were cited by Pope Francis in the 2015 encyclical, <i>Laudato si\'</i>. The response to his writings by evolutionary biologists has been, with some exceptions, decidedly negative.

He is author of the 1920 Austrian Constitution, which to a very large degree is still valid today. Due to the rise of totalitarianism in Austria (and a 1929 constitutional change), Kelsen left for Germany in 1930 but was forced to leave this university post after Hitler\'s seizure of power in 1933 because of his Jewish ancestry. That year he left for Geneva and later moved to the United States in 1940. In 1934, Roscoe Pound lauded Kelsen as "undoubtedly the leading jurist of the time." While in Vienna, Kelsen met Sigmund Freud and his circle, and wrote on the subject of social psychology and sociology.
</p><p>By the 1940s, Kelsen\'s reputation was already well established in the United States for his defense of democracy and for his Pure Theory of Law. Kelsen\'s academic stature exceeded legal theory alone and extended to political philosophy and social theory as well. His influence encompassed the fields of philosophy, legal science, sociology, the theory of democracy, and international relations.
</p><p>Late in his career while at the University of California, Berkeley, although officially retired in 1952, Kelsen rewrote his short book of 1934, <i>Reine Rechtslehre</i> (<i>Pure Theory of Law</i>), into a much enlarged "second edition" published in 1960 (it appeared in an English translation in 1967). Kelsen throughout his active career was also a significant contributor to the theory of judicial review, the hierarchical and dynamic theory of positive law, and the science of law. In political philosophy he was a defender of the state-law identity theory and an advocate of explicit contrast of the themes of centralization and decentralization in the theory of government. Kelsen was also an advocate of the position of separation of the concepts of state and society in their relation to the study of the science of law.
</p><p>The reception and criticism of Kelsen\'s work and contributions has been extensive with both ardent supporters and detractors. Kelsen\'s contributions to legal theory of the Nuremberg trials was supported and contested by various authors including Dinstein at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Kelsen\'s neo-Kantian defense of continental legal positivism was supported by H. L. A. Hart in its contrasting form of Anglo-American legal positivism, which was debated in its Anglo-American form by scholars such as Ronald Dworkin and Jeremy Waldron.

Raised Protestant, he was agnostic before converting to Catholicism in 1906. An author of more than 60 books, he helped to revive Thomas Aquinas for modern times, and was influential in the development and drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pope Paul VI presented his "Message to Men of Thought and of Science" at the close of Vatican II to Maritain, his long-time friend and mentor. The same pope had seriously considered making him a lay Cardinal, but Maritain rejected it. Maritain\'s interest and works spanned many aspects of philosophy, including aesthetics, political theory, philosophy of science, metaphysics, the nature of education, liturgy and ecclesiology.

He worked during the first half of the 20th century, while Spain oscillated between monarchy, republicanism, and dictatorship. His philosophy has been characterized as a "philosophy of life" that "comprised a long-hidden beginning in a pragmatist metaphysics inspired by William James, and with a general method from a realist phenomenology imitating Edmund Husserl, which served both his proto-existentialism (prior to Martin Heidegger\'s) and his realist historicism, which has been compared to both Wilhelm Dilthey and Benedetto Croce."</p>',

He made contributions in the fields of poetics and the philosophy of science. To the latter he introduced the concepts of <i>epistemological obstacle</i> and <i>epistemological break</i> (<i>obstacle épistémologique</i> and <i>rupture épistémologique</i>). He influenced many subsequent French philosophers, among them Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Dominique Lecourt and Jacques Derrida, as well as the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu.

</p>
<p><b>György Lukács</b> (also <b>Georg Lukács</b>; born <b>György Bernát Löwinger</b>; 13 April 1885 – 4 June 1971) was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher, aesthetician, literary historian, and critic. He was one of the founders of Western Marxism, an interpretive tradition that departed from the Marxist ideological orthodoxy of the Soviet Union. He developed the theory of reification, and contributed to Marxist theory with developments of Karl Marx\'s theory of class consciousness. He was also a philosopher of Leninism. He ideologically developed and organised Lenin\'s pragmatic revolutionary practices into the formal philosophy of vanguard-party revolution.
</p><p>As a literary critic Lukács was especially influential, because of his theoretical developments of realism and of the novel as a literary genre. In 1919, he was appointed the Hungarian Minister of Culture of the government of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic (March–August 1919).</p><p>Lukács has been described as the preeminent Marxist intellectual of the Stalinist era, though assessing his legacy can be difficult as Lukács seemed both to support Stalinism as the embodiment of Marxist thought, and yet also to champion a return to pre-Stalinist Marxism.</p>',

<p><b>Walter Terence Stace</b> (17 November 1886 – 2 August 1967) was a British civil servant, educator, public philosopher and epistemologist, who wrote on Hegel, mysticism, and moral relativism. He worked with the Ceylon Civil Service from 1910-1932, and from 1932-1955 he was employed by Princeton University in the Department of Philosophy. He is most renowned for his work in the philosophy of mysticism, and for books like <i>Mysticism and Philosophy</i> (1960) and <i>Teachings of the Mystics</i> (1960). These works have been influential in the study of mysticism, but they have also been severely criticised for their lack of methodological rigor and their perennialist pre-assumptions.

<p><b>Karl Barth</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[baɐ̯t]</span>; <span>(<span>1886-05-10</span>)</span>May 10, 1886 – <span>(<span>1968-12-10</span>)</span>December 10, 1968) was a Swiss Reformed theologian who is often regarded as the greatest Protestant theologian of the twentieth century. His influence expanded well beyond the academic realm to mainstream culture, leading him to be featured on the cover of <i>Time</i> on April 20, 1962.</p><p>Beginning with his experience as a pastor, Barth rejected his training in the predominant liberal theology typical of 19th-century European Protestantism. He also rejected more conservative forms of Christianity. Instead he embarked on a new theological path initially called dialectical theology due to its stress on the paradoxical nature of divine truth (e.g., God\'s relationship to humanity embodies both grace and judgment). Many critics have referred to Barth as the father of neo-orthodoxy – a term that Barth emphatically rejected. A more charitable description of his work might be "a theology of the Word". Barth\'s work had a profound impact on twentieth century theology and figures such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer – who supported the Confessing Church – Thomas F. Torrance, Reinhold Niebuhr, Jacques Ellul, Stanley Hauerwas, Hans Küng, Jürgen Moltmann, and novelists such as John Updike and Miklós Szentkuthy.
</p><p>Barth\'s unease with the dominant theology which characterized Europe led him to become a leader in the Confessing Church in Germany, which actively opposed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. In particular, Barth and other members of the movement vigorously attempted to prevent the Nazis from taking over the existing church and establishing a state church controlled by the regime. This culminated in Barth\'s authorship of the Barmen Declaration, which fiercely criticized Christians who supported the Nazis.</p><p>He was one of the most prolific and influential theologians of the twentieth century. Barth emphasized the sovereignty of God, particularly through his reinterpretation of the Calvinistic doctrine of election, the sinfulness of humanity, and the "infinite qualitative distinction between God and mankind". His most famous works are his <i>The Epistle to the Romans</i>, which marked a clear break from his earlier thinking, and his massive thirteen-volume work <i>Church Dogmatics</i>, one of the largest works of systematic theology ever written.</p>',

<p><b>Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈluːtvɪç ˈvɪtgənˌʃtaɪn]</span>; 26 April 1889 – 29 April 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. From 1929 to 1947, Wittgenstein taught at the University of Cambridge. During his lifetime he published just one slim book, the 75-page <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> (1921),  one article, one book review and a children\'s dictionary. His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously.  <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> appeared as a book in 1953, and has since come to be recognised as one of the most important works of philosophy in the twentieth century. His teacher, Bertrand Russell, described Wittgenstein as "the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, and dominating".</p><p>Born in Vienna into one of Europe\'s richest families, he inherited a fortune from his father in 1913. He initially made some donations to artists and writers and then, in a period of severe personal depression after the First World War, he gave away his entire fortune to his brothers and sisters. Three of his brothers committed suicide, with Wittgenstein contemplating it too. He left academia several times—serving as an officer on the front line during World War I, where he was decorated a number of times for his courage; teaching in schools in remote Austrian villages where he encountered controversy for hitting children when they made mistakes in mathematics; and working as a hospital porter during World War II in London where he told patients not to take the drugs they were prescribed while largely managing to keep secret the fact that he was one of the world\'s most famous philosophers. He described philosophy as "the only work that gives me real satisfaction".</p><p>His philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the <i>Tractatus</i>, and a later period, articulated in the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. The early Wittgenstein was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world and believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, he had solved all philosophical problems. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the assumptions of the <i>Tractatus</i>, arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given language-game.</p><p>A survey among American university and college teachers ranked the <i>Investigations</i> as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations." The <i>Investigations</i> also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the University of Minnesota\'s Center for Cognitive Sciences. However, in the words of his friend Georg Henrik von Wright, he believed "his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men."</p>',

The author of over a dozen books and at least thirty plays, Marcel\'s work focused on the modern individual\'s struggle in a technologically dehumanizing society. Though often regarded as the first French existentialist, he dissociated himself from figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre, preferring the term \'Philosophy of Existence\' or "neo-Socrateanism" to define his own thought. <i>The Mystery of Being</i> is a well-known two-volume work authored by Marcel.

Heidegger is best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism, though as the <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> cautions, "his thinking should be identified as part of such philosophical movements only with extreme care and qualification". His membership in and support for the Nazi Party remains controversial.
</p><p>His first and best known book, <i>Being and Time</i> (1927), though unfinished, is one of the central philosophical works of the 20th century. In its first part, Heidegger attempted to turn away from "ontic" questions about beings to ontological questions about Being, and recover the most fundamental philosophical question: the question of Being, of what it means for something to be. Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which he called <i>Dasein</i> ("being-there"). Heidegger argued that <i>Dasein</i> is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of being-in-the-world, in opposition to such Rationalist thinkers as René Descartes who located the essence of man in his thinking abilities.
</p><p>For Heidegger thinking is thinking <i>about</i> things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second part of his book, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its Temporality, or its concern with, and relationship to time, existing as a structurally open "possibility-for-being". He emphasized the importance of Authenticity in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our thrownness into a world which we are "always already" concerned with, and to our being-towards-death, the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.</p><p>Heidegger also made critical contributions to philosophical conceptions of truth, arguing that its original meaning was unconcealment, to philosophical analyses of art as a site of the revelation of truth, and to philosophical understanding of language as the "house of being." Heidegger\'s later work includes criticisms of technology\'s instrumentalist understanding in the Western tradition as "enframing", treating all of Nature as a "standing reserve" on call for human purposes. Heidegger is a controversial figure, largely for his affiliation with Nazism, as Rector of the University of Freiburg for 11 months, before his resignation in April 1934, for which he neither apologized nor publicly expressed regret.</p>',

He wrote on political theory, sociology and linguistics. He attempted to break from the economic determinism of traditional Marxist thought and so is considered a key neo-Marxist. He was a founding member and one-time leader of the Communist Party of Italy and was imprisoned by Benito Mussolini\'s Fascist regime.
</p><p>He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. His <i>Prison Notebooks</i> are considered a highly original contribution to 20th century political theory. Gramsci drew insights from varying sources – not only other Marxists but also thinkers such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Vilfredo Pareto, Georges Sorel and Benedetto Croce. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including Italian history and nationalism, the French Revolution, fascism, Fordism, civil society, folklore, religion and high and popular culture.
</p><p>Gramsci is best known for his theory of cultural hegemony, which describes how the state and ruling capitalist class – the bourgeoisie – use cultural institutions to maintain power in capitalist societies. The bourgeoisie, in Gramsci\'s view, develops a hegemonic culture using ideology rather than violence, economic force, or coercion. Hegemonic culture propagates its own values and norms so that they become the "common sense" values of all and thus maintain the <i>status quo</i>. Hegemonic power is therefore used to maintain consent to the capitalist order, rather than coercive power using force to maintain order. This cultural hegemony is produced and reproduced by the dominant class through the institutions that form the superstructure.

An eclectic thinker, combining elements of German idealism, Romanticism, Western Marxism, and Jewish mysticism, Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to aesthetic theory, literary criticism, and historical materialism. He was associated with the Frankfurt School, and also maintained formative friendships with thinkers such as playwright Bertolt Brecht and Kabbalah scholar Gershom Scholem. He was also related by law to German political theorist and philosopher Hannah Arendt through her first marriage to Benjamin\'s cousin, Günther Anders.
</p><p>Among Benjamin\'s best known works are the essays "The Task of the Translator" (1923), "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1936), and "Theses on the Philosophy of History" (1940). His major work as a literary critic included essays on Baudelaire, Goethe, Kafka, Kraus, Leskov, Proust, Walser, and translation theory. He also made major translations into German of the <i>Tableaux Parisiens</i> section of Baudelaire\'s <i>Les Fleurs du mal</i> and parts of Proust\'s <i>À la recherche du temps perdu</i>. In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin committed suicide at Portbou on the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape from invading Nazi forces. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.

After receiving a B.A. from Beloit College in 1915, and an MA from Yale University in 1919, he went on to Harvard University where he earned another MA in 1922 and a Ph.D. in 1924. Northrop was an influential comparative philosopher. His most influential work, The Meeting of East and West, was published in 1946 at the aftermath of World War II. Its central thesis is that East and West both must learn something from each other to avoid future conflict and to flourish together. 
</p><p>He was appointed to the Yale faculty in 1923 as an instructor in Philosophy, and later was named professor in 1932.  In 1947 he was appointed Sterling Professor of Philosophy and Law. He chaired the Philosophy department from 1938 to 1940 and was the first Master of Silliman College, from 1940 to 1947.
</p><p>Northrop was personally acquainted with and close to a great number of leading figures in philosophy, politics, and science. These included G. H. Hardy, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Schroedinger, Hermann Weyl, Norbert Wiener, Mao Zedong, John Foster Dulles and Mohammed Iqbal, among many others. For instance, see the dedication to "Man, Nature, and God."
</p><p>He was the author of twelve books and innumerable articles on all major branches of philosophy.  Chapter-length studies of seven of these books can be found in Fred Seddon’s <i>An Introduction to the Philosophical Works of F. S. C. Northrop</i>.

Born in Berlin, Marcuse studied at the universities of Berlin and then at Freiburg, where he received his PhD. He was a prominent figure in the Frankfurt-based Institute for Social Research – what later became known as the Frankfurt School. He was married to Sophie Wertheim (1924–1951), Inge Neumann (1955–1973), and Erica Sherover (1976–1979). In his written works, he criticized capitalism, modern technology, historical materialism and entertainment culture, arguing that they represent new forms of social control.</p><p>Between 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in US government service for the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) where he criticized the ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the book <i>Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis</i> (1958). After his studies, in the 1960s and the 1970s he became known as the preeminent theorist of the New Left and the student movements of West Germany, France, and the United States; some consider him the "father of the New Left".</p><p>His best known works are <i>Eros and Civilization</i> (1955) and <i>One-Dimensional Man</i> (1964). His Marxist scholarship inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the United States and internationally.  He viewed the integration of Eros and <i>Logos</i> to be the liberation of society.</p>',

<p><b>Gilbert Ryle</b> (19 August 1900 – 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher. He was a representative of the generation of British ordinary language philosophers who shared Wittgenstein\'s approach to philosophical problems, and is principally known for his critique of Cartesian dualism, for which he coined the phrase "the ghost in the machine." Some of his ideas in the philosophy of mind have been referred to as "behaviourist." Ryle\'s best known book is <i>The Concept of Mind</i> (1949), in which he writes that the "general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as \'behaviourist\'." Ryle, having engaged in detailed study of the key works of Bernard Bolzano, Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, Edmund Husserl, and Martin Heidegger, himself suggested instead that the book "could be described as a sustained essay in phenomenology, if you are at home with that label."</p>',

</p>

<p><b>Sir Karl Raimund Popper</b>  (28 July 1902 – 17 September 1994) was an Austrian-British philosopher and professor.</p><p>Generally regarded as one of the 20th century\'s greatest philosophers of science, Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method in favour of empirical falsification. A theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can and should be scrutinized by decisive experiments. Popper is also known for his opposition to the classical justificationist account of knowledge, which he replaced with critical rationalism, namely "the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy".</p><p>In political discourse, he is known for his vigorous defence of liberal democracy and the principles of social criticism that he came to believe made a flourishing open society possible. His political philosophy embraces ideas from all major democratic political ideologies and attempts to reconcile them, namely socialism/social democracy, libertarianism/classical liberalism and conservatism.</p>',

<p><b>Frank Plumpton Ramsey</b> (<span></span>; 22 February 1903 – 19 January 1930) was a British philosopher, mathematician and economist who made fundamental contributions to abstract algebra before his death at the age of 26. He was a close friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein and was instrumental in translating Wittgenstein\'s <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> into English, as well as persuading Wittgenstein to return to philosophy and Cambridge. Like Wittgenstein, he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, the intellectual secret society, from 1921.

</p>
<p><b>Theodor W. Adorno</b> (<span></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʔaˈdɔɐ̯no]</span>; born <b>Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund</b>; September 11, 1903 – August 6, 1969) was a German philosopher, sociologist, and composer known for his critical theory of society.
</p><p>He was a leading member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Freud, Marx, and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century\'s foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i> (1947), <i>Minima Moralia</i> (1951) and <i>Negative Dialectics</i> (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.
</p><p>Amidst the vogue enjoyed by existentialism and positivism in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception of natural history that critiqued the twin temptations of ontology and empiricism through studies of Kierkegaard and Husserl. As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of Arnold Schoenberg resulted in his studying composition with Alban Berg of the Second Viennese School, Adorno\'s commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with Thomas Mann on the latter\'s novel <i>Doctor Faustus</i>, while the two men lived in California as exiles during the Second World War. Working for the newly relocated Institute for Social Research, Adorno collaborated on influential studies of authoritarianism, antisemitism and propaganda that would later serve as models for sociological studies the Institute carried out in post-war Germany.
</p><p>Upon his return to Frankfurt, Adorno was involved with the reconstitution of German intellectual life through debates with Karl Popper on the limitations of positivist science, critiques of Heidegger\'s language of authenticity, writings on German responsibility for the Holocaust, and continued interventions into matters of public policy. As a writer of polemics in the tradition of Nietzsche and Karl Kraus, Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture. Adorno\'s posthumously published <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>, which he planned to dedicate to Samuel Beckett, is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art which attempts to revoke the "fatal separation" of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion.

<p><b>Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre</b> (<span></span>, <span>US also</span> <span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[saʁtʁ]</span>; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, political activist, biographer, and literary critic. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of existentialism and phenomenology, and one of the leading figures in 20th-century French philosophy and Marxism. His work has also influenced sociology, critical theory, post-colonial theory, and literary studies, and continues to influence these disciplines.
</p><p>Sartre was also noted for his open relationship with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher and writer Simone de Beauvoir. Together, Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the cultural and social assumptions and expectations of their upbringings, which they considered bourgeois, in both lifestyle and thought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive conformity (<i>mauvaise foi</i>, literally, "bad faith") and an "authentic" way of "being" became the dominant theme of Sartre\'s early work, a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work <i>Being and Nothingness</i> (<i>L\'Être et le Néant</i>, 1943). Sartre\'s introduction to his philosophy is his work <i>Existentialism and Humanism</i> (<i>L\'existentialisme est un humanisme</i>, 1946), originally presented as a lecture.
</p><p>He was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature despite attempting to refuse it, saying that he always declined official honours and that "a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution".</p>

</p>
<p><b>Ayn Rand</b> (<span></span>; born <b>Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum</b>; February 2 [O.S. January 20] 1905 – March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American writer and philosopher. She is known for her two best-selling novels, <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 and 1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, <i>The Fountainhead</i>. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.
</p><p>Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals.</p><p>Literary critics received Rand\'s fiction with mixed reviews and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.</p>',

<p><b>Kurt Friedrich Gödel</b> (<span><small>UK: </small></span>, <span><small>US: </small></span>; <small>German: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈkʊɐ̯t ˈɡøːdl̩]</span><small class="nowrap"> (<span><span><span> </span>listen</span></span>)</small>; April 28, 1906 – January 14, 1978) was an Austrian, and later American, logician, mathematician, and philosopher. Considered along with Aristotle, Alfred Tarski and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gödel made an immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, and David Hilbert were analyzing the use of logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics pioneered by Georg Cantor.
</p><p>Gödel published his two incompleteness theorems in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the axioms. To prove this theorem, Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers.
</p><p>He also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory, assuming these axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.

Her many books and articles on topics ranging from totalitarianism to epistemology have had a lasting influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century.
</p><p>Arendt was born in Hanover, but largely raised in Königsberg in a secular merchant Jewish culture to parents who were politically progressive, being supporters of the Social Democrats. Her father died when she was seven, so she was raised by her mother and grandfather. After completing her secondary education, she studied at the University of Marburg under Martin Heidegger, with whom she had a brief affair, but who had a lasting influence on her thinking. She obtained her doctorate in philosophy in 1929 at the University of Heidelberg with Karl Jaspers.
</p><p>Hannah Arendt married Günther Stern in 1929, but soon began to encounter increasing antisemitism in 1930s Germany. Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, and while researching antisemitic propaganda for the Zionist Federation of Germany in Berlin that year, Arendt was denounced and briefly imprisoned by the Gestapo. On release, she fled Germany, living in Czechoslovakia and Switzerland before settling in Paris. There she worked for Youth Aliyah, assisting young Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Divorcing Stern in 1937, she married Heinrich Blücher in 1940, but when Germany invaded France in 1940 she was detained by the French as an alien, despite having been stripped of her German citizenship in 1937. She escaped and made her way to the United States in 1941 via Portugal. She settled in New York, which remained her principal residence for the rest of her life. She became a writer and editor and worked for the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, becoming an American citizen in 1950. With the appearance of <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i> in 1951, her reputation as a thinker and writer was established and a series of seminal works followed. These included <i>The Human Condition</i> in 1958, and both <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i> and <i>On Revolution</i> in 1963. She taught at many American universities, while declining tenure-track appointments. She died suddenly from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 69, leaving her last work, <i>The Life of the Mind</i>, unfinished.
</p><p>
Her works cover a broad range of topics, but she is best known for those dealing with the nature of power and evil, as well as politics, direct democracy, authority, and totalitarianism. In the popular mind she is best remembered for the controversy surrounding the trial of Adolf Eichmann, her attempt to explain how ordinary people become actors in totalitarian systems, which was considered an apologia, and for the phrase "the banality of evil". She is commemorated by institutions and journals devoted to her thinking, the Hannah Arendt Prize for political thinking, and on stamps, street names and schools, amongst other things.</p>',

The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception, art, and politics. He was on the editorial board of <i>Les Temps modernes</i>, the leftist magazine established by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.
</p><p>At the core of Merleau-Ponty\'s philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the world.  Like the other major phenomenologists, Merleau-Ponty expressed his philosophical insights in writings on art, literature, linguistics, and politics. He was the only major phenomenologist of the first half of the twentieth century to engage extensively with the sciences and especially with descriptive psychology. It is through this engagement that his writings became influential in the project of naturalizing phenomenology, in which phenomenologists use the results of psychology and cognitive science.
</p><p>Merleau-Ponty emphasized the body as the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of knowledge, and maintained that the body and that which it perceived could not be disentangled from each other. The articulation of the primacy of embodiment led him away from phenomenology towards what he was to call “indirect ontology” or the ontology of “the flesh of the world” (<i>la chair du monde</i>), seen in his final and incomplete work, <i>The Visible and Invisible</i>, and his last published essay, “Eye and Mind”.
</p><p>Merleau-Ponty supported Soviet communism and his endorsement of the Soviet show trials and prison camps was published as <i>Humanism and Terror</i> in 1947.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Willard Van Orman Quine</b> (<span></span>; known to intimates as "Van"; June 25, 1908 – December 25, 2000) was an American philosopher  and logician in the analytic tradition, recognized as "one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century." From 1930 until his death 70 years later, Quine was continually affiliated with Harvard University in one way or another, first as a student, then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of logic and set theory, and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several books in retirement. He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978. A 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries.  He won the first Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 1993 for "his systematical and penetrating discussions of how learning of language and communication are based on socially available evidence and of the consequences of this for theories on knowledge and linguistic meaning." In 1996 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for his "outstanding contributions to the progress of philosophy in the 20th century by proposing numerous theories based on keen insights in logic, epistemology, philosophy of science and philosophy of language."</p><p>Quine falls squarely into the analytic philosophy tradition while also being the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not conceptual analysis but the abstract branch of the empirical sciences.  His major writings include "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1951), which attacked the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions and advocated a form of semantic holism, and <i>Word and Object</i> (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine\'s famous indeterminacy of translation thesis, advocating a behaviorist theory of meaning. He also developed an influential naturalized epistemology that tried to provide "an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input." He is also important in philosophy of science for his "systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself" and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science. This led to his famous quip that "philosophy of science is philosophy enough." In philosophy of mathematics, he and his Harvard colleague Hilary Putnam developed the "Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis," an argument for the reality of mathematical entities.</p>',

The mathematician Andre Weil was her brother.</p><p>After her graduation from formal education, Weil became a teacher. She taught intermittently throughout the 1930s, taking several breaks due to poor health and to devote herself to political activism, work that would see her assisting in the trade union movement, taking the side of the Anarchists known as the Durruti Column in the Spanish Civil War, and spending more than a year working as a labourer, mostly in auto factories, so she could better understand the working class.
</p><p>Taking a path that was unusual among twentieth-century left-leaning intellectuals, she became more religious and inclined towards mysticism as her life progressed. Weil wrote throughout her life, though most of her writings did not attract much attention until after her death. In the 1950s and 1960s, her work became famous in continental Europe and throughout the English-speaking world. Her thought has continued to be the subject of extensive scholarship across a wide range of fields. A meta study from the University of Calgary found that between 1995 and 2012 over 2,500 new scholarly works had been published about her.Albert Camus described her as "the only great spirit of our times".</p>',

<p><b>John Langshaw Austin</b> (26 March 1911 – 8 February 1960) was a British philosopher of language and leading proponent of ordinary language philosophy, perhaps best known for developing the theory of speech acts.</p><p>Austin pointed out that we use language to <i>do</i> things as well as to <i>assert</i> things, and that the utterance of a statement like "I promise to do so-and-so" is best understood as <i>doing</i> something —  <i>making a promise</i> —  rather than making an assertion about anything. Hence the name of one of his best-known works <i>How to Do Things with Words</i>. Austin, in providing his theory of speech acts, makes a significant challenge to the philosophy of language, far beyond merely elucidating a class of morphological sentence forms that function to do what they name. Austin\'s work ultimately suggests that all speech and all utterance is the doing of something with words and signs, challenging a metaphysics of language that would posit denotative, propositional assertion as the essence of language and meaning.

<p><b>Herbert Marshall McLuhan</b>  (<span></span>; July 21, 1911 – December 31, 1980) was a Canadian professor, philosopher, and public intellectual. His work is one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. Born in Edmonton, Alberta, McLuhan studied at the University of Manitoba and the University of Cambridge. He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the University of Toronto in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.
</p><p>McLuhan is known for coining the expression "the medium is the message" and the term global village, and for predicting the World Wide Web almost 30 years before it was invented. He was a fixture in media discourse in the late 1960s, though his influence began to wane in the early 1970s. In the years after his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles. With the arrival of the Internet and the World Wide Web interest was renewed in his work and perspective.</p>',

<p><b>Alan Mathison Turing</b>  (<span></span>; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist,  logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality, which was then a crime in the UK.
</p><p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain\'s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war. Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.</p><p>After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman\'s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.
</p><p>Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the Labouchere Amendment, "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated." Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.</p>

His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He wrote in his essay <i>The Rebel</i> that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual freedom. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44 in 1957, the second youngest recipient in history.</p><p>Camus did not consider himself to be an existentialist despite usually being classified as a follower of it, even in his lifetime. In a 1945 interview, Camus rejected any ideological associations: "No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked."</p><p>Camus was born in French Algeria to a <i>Pied-Noir</i> family and studied at the University of Algiers, from which he graduated in 1936. In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons to "denounce two ideologies found in both the USSR and the USA".</p>',

In 2000, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for having "revolutionized the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, expanding the study of textual interpretation to include the broad yet concrete domains of mythology, biblical exegesis, psychoanalysis, theory of metaphor, and narrative theory."</p>',

<p><b>John Leslie Mackie</b>, FBA (25 August 1917 – 12 December 1981), was an Australian philosopher, originally from Sydney. He made significant contributions to the philosophy of religion, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language, and is perhaps best known for his views on meta-ethics, especially his defence of moral scepticism.
</p><p>He authored six books. His most widely known, <i>Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong</i> (1977), opens by boldly stating that "There are no objective values." It goes on to argue that because of this ethics must be invented, rather than discovered.

He served as Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley from 1981 to 2003 after having also held teaching appointments at Stanford University, Rockefeller University, Princeton University, and the University of Chicago. Davidson was known for his charismatic personality and the depth and difficulty of his thought. His work exerted considerable influence in many areas of philosophy from the 1960s onward, particularly in philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and action theory. While Davidson was an analytic philosopher, and most of his influence lies in that tradition, his work has attracted attention in continental philosophy as well, particularly in literary theory and related areas.</p><p>Although published mostly in the form of short, terse essays that do not explicitly rely on any overriding theory, his work is nonetheless noted for a highly unified character, the same methods and ideas brought to bear on a host of apparently unrelated problems, and for synthesizing the work of a great number of other philosophers. He developed an influential truth-conditional semantics, attacked the idea of mental events as governed by strict psychological laws, and rejected the conception of linguistic understanding as having to do with conventions or rules, concluding famously that "there is no such thing as a language, not if a language is anything like what many philosophers and linguists have supposed. There is therefore no such thing to be learned, mastered, or born with." His philosophical work, as a whole, is said to be concerned with how human beings communicate and interact with one another.

He was born in Algeria and studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he eventually became Professor of Philosophy.
</p><p>Althusser was a longtime member—although sometimes a strong critic—of the French Communist Party. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory, and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist parties, as well as the problem of the "cult of personality" and of ideology.
</p><p>Althusser is commonly referred to as a Structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of structuralism.
</p><p>Althusser\'s life was marked by periods of intense mental illness. In 1980, he killed his wife, the sociologist Hélène Rytmann, by strangling her. He was declared unfit to stand trial due to insanity and was committed to a psychiatric hospital for three years. He did little further academic work, dying in 1990.

<p><b>Richard Mervyn Hare</b> (<span></span>; 21 March 1919 – 29 January 2002), usually cited as <b>R. M. Hare</b>, was an English moral philosopher who held the post of White\'s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford from 1966 until 1983. He subsequently taught for a number of years at the University of Florida. His meta-ethical theories were influential during the second half of the twentieth century.
</p><p>Hare is best known for his development of prescriptivism as a meta-ethical theory, the analysis of formal features of moral discourse justifying preference utilitarianism.
</p><p>Some of Hare\'s students, such as Brian McGuinness, John Lucas and Bernard Williams, went on to become well-known philosophers. Peter Singer, known for his involvement with the animal liberation movement, was also a student of Hare\'s, and has explicitly adopted some elements of Hare\'s thought, though not his doctrine of universal prescriptivism.

<p><b>Sir Peter Frederick Strawson</b> FBA (<span></span>; 23 November 1919 – 13 February 2006), usually cited as <b>P. F. Strawson</b>, was an English philosopher.  He was the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at the University of Oxford (Magdalen College) from 1968 to 1987. Before that, he was appointed as a college lecturer at University College, Oxford, in 1947, and became a tutorial fellow the following year, until 1968. On his retirement in 1987, he returned to the college and continued working there until shortly before his death. His portrait was painted by the artists Muli Tang and Daphne Todd.</p><p>When he died, the obituary in <i>The Guardian</i> noted that, "Oxford was the world capital of philosophy between 1950 and 1970, and American academics flocked there, rather than the traffic going the other way. That golden age had no greater philosopher than Sir Peter Strawson."</p>',

He held the James Bryant Conant University Professorship at Harvard University and the Fulbright Fellowship at the University of Oxford. Rawls received both the Schock Prize for Logic and Philosophy and the National Humanities Medal in 1999, the latter presented by President Bill Clinton, in recognition of how Rawls\'s work "helped a whole generation of learned Americans revive their faith in democracy itself."</p><p>In his 1990 introduction to the field, Will Kymlicka wrote that "it is generally accepted that the recent rebirth of normative political philosophy began with the publication of John Rawls\'s <i>A Theory of Justice</i> in 1971." Rawls has often been described as the most important political philosopher of the 20th century. He has the unusual distinction among contemporary political philosophers of being frequently cited by the courts of law in the United States and Canada and referred to by practising politicians in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Rawls\'s theory of "justice as fairness" recommends equal basic rights, equality of opportunity, and promoting the interests of the least advantaged members of society. Rawls\'s argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the "original position", in which people select what kind of society they would choose to live under if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy. In his later work <i>Political Liberalism</i> (1993), Rawls turned to the question of how political power could be made legitimate given reasonable disagreement about the nature of the good life.

<p><b>Zygmunt Bauman</b> (<span></span>; 19 November 1925 – 9 January 2017) was a Polish sociologist and philosopher. He was driven out of Poland by a political purge in 1968 engineered by the Communist government of the Polish People\'s Republic and forced to give up his Polish citizenship to move to Israel. Three years later he moved to the United Kingdom. He resided in England from 1971 and became Professor of Sociology at the University of Leeds, later Emeritus.

As an intellectual, Fanon was a political radical, Pan-Africanist, and Marxist humanist concerned with the psychopathology of colonization, and the human, social, and cultural consequences of decolonization.</p><p>In the course of his work as a physician and psychiatrist, Fanon supported the Algerian War of Independence from France, and was a member of the Algerian National Liberation Front. For more than five decades, the life and works of Frantz Fanon have inspired national liberation movements and other radical political organizations in Palestine, Sri Lanka, South Africa, and the United States. In <i>What Fanon Said: A Philosophical Introduction To His Life And Thought</i>, leading African scholar and contemporary philosopher Lewis R. Gordon remarked that
</p>
<blockquote><p>Fanon\'s contributions to the history of ideas are manifold. He is influential not only because of the originality of his thought but also because of the astuteness of his criticisms. He developed a profound social existential analysis of antiblack racism, which led him to identify conditions of skewed rationality and reason in contemporary discourses on the human being.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fanon published numerous books, including <i>The Wretched of the Earth</i> (1961). This influential work focuses on what he believes is the necessary role of violence by activists in conducting decolonization struggles.

<p><b>Paul-Michel Foucault</b> (<span></span>; 15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984), generally known as <b>Michel Foucault</b> (<small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[miʃɛl fuko]</span>), was a French philosopher, historian of ideas, social theorist, and literary critic.
</p><p>Foucault\'s theories primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge, and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions. Though often cited as a post-structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels, preferring to present his thought as a critical history of modernity. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in communication studies, sociology, cultural studies, literary theory, feminism, and critical theory. Activist groups have also found his theories compelling.
</p><p>Born in Poitiers, France, into an upper-middle-class family, Foucault was educated at the Lycée Henri-IV, at the École Normale Supérieure, where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, <i>The History of Madness</i> (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, he produced <i>The Birth of the Clinic</i> (1963) and <i>The Order of Things</i> (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing called "archaeology".
</p><p>From 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published <i>The Archaeology of Knowledge</i> (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Collège de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published <i>Discipline and Punish</i> (1975) and <i>The History of Sexuality</i> (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.
</p><p>Foucault died in Paris of neurological problems compounded by HIV/AIDS; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease. His partner Daniel Defert founded the AIDES charity in his memory.

<p><b>Hilary Whitehall Putnam</b> (<span></span>; July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, and computer scientist, and a major figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He made significant contributions to philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. At the time of his death, Putnam was Cogan University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University.
</p><p>He was known for his willingness to apply an equal degree of scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his own position.</p><p>In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem. In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a famous thought experiment called Twin Earth.</p><p>In philosophy of mathematics, he and his mentor W. V. O. Quine developed the "Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis", an argument for the reality of mathematical entities, later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but "quasi-empirical". In the field of epistemology, he is known for his critique of the well known "brain in a vat" thought experiment. This thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, but Putnam challenges its coherence.</p><p>In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called "internal realism", which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career he remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.</p><p>In the philosophy of perception Putnam came to endorse direct realism, according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world. In the past, he further held that there are no mental representations, sense data, or other intermediaries that stand between the mind and the world. By 2012, however, he rejected this further commitment, in favor of "transactionalism", a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world-involving transactions, and that these transactions are functionally describable (provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function). Such transactions can further involve qualia.</p><p>In his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, thus engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to "renew philosophy" from what he identifies as narrow and inflated concerns.</p><p>Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert\'s tenth problem. He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>',

<p><b>David Malet Armstrong</b> (8 July 1926 – 13 May 2014), often <b>D. M. Armstrong</b>, was an Australian philosopher. He is well known for his work on metaphysics and the philosophy of mind, and for his defence of a factualist ontology, a functionalist theory of the mind, an externalist epistemology, and a necessitarian conception of the laws of nature. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008.</p><p>Keith Campbell said that Armstrong\'s contributions to metaphysics and epistemology "helped to shape philosophy\'s agenda and terms of debate", and that Armstrong\'s work "always concerned to elaborate and defend a philosophy which is ontically economical, synoptic, and compatibly continuous with established results in the natural sciences".</p>',

<p><b>Avram Noam Chomsky</b> (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, and social critic. Sometimes described as "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.
</p><p>Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He began studying at the University of Pennsylvania at age 16, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955, he was appointed to Harvard University\'s Society of Fellows. While at Harvard, he developed the theory of transformational grammar; for this, he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. Chomsky began teaching at MIT in 1957 and emerged as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work <i>Syntactic Structures</i>, which remodelled the scientific study of language. From 1958 to 1959, he was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. Chomsky is credited as the creator or co-creator of the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism, being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.
</p><p>Chomsky vocally opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, believing the war to be an act of American imperialism. In 1967, Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay entitled "The Responsibility of Intellectuals". Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and was placed on Nixon\'s "Enemies List". While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the Linguistics Wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later co-wrote an analysis, which articulated the propaganda model of media criticism, and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. Additionally, his defense of freedom of speech—including free speech for Holocaust deniers—generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the early 1980s. Following his retirement from active teaching, Chomsky has continued his vocal political activism by opposing the War on Terror and supporting the Occupy Movement.
</p><p>One of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped spark a major revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proved highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements. Some of his critics have accused him of anti-Americanism.

<p><b>Sir Bernard Arthur Owen Williams</b>, FBA (21 September 1929 – 10 June 2003) was an English moral philosopher. His publications include <i>Problems of the Self</i> (1973), <i>Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy</i> (1985), <i>Shame and Necessity</i> (1993), and <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i> (2002). He was knighted in 1999.
</p><p>As Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, Williams became known for his efforts to reorient the study of moral philosophy to psychology, history, and in particular to the Greeks. Described by Colin McGinn as an "analytical philosopher with the soul of a general humanist," he was sceptical about attempts to create a foundation for moral philosophy. Martha Nussbaum wrote that he demanded of philosophy that it "come to terms with, and contain, the difficulty and complexity of human life."</p><p>Williams was a strong supporter of women in academia; according to Nussbaum, he was "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams\'s mentors at Oxford, said that he "understands what you\'re going to say better than you understand it yourself, and sees all the possible objections to it, and all the possible answers to all the possible objections, before you\'ve got to the end of your own sentence."</p>',

He is perhaps best known for his theories on communicative rationality and the public sphere. In 2014, <i>Prospect</i> readers chose Habermas as one of their favourites among the "world\'s leading thinkers".</p><p>Associated with the Frankfurt School, Habermas\'s work focuses on the foundations of epistemology and social theory, the analysis of advanced capitalism and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas\'s theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism, action theory, and even poststructuralism.

He subsequently taught at Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Yale University, École Normale Supérieure of Paris, and the University of Chicago. Bloom championed the idea of Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, <i>The Closing of the American Mind</i>. Characterized as a conservative in the popular media, Bloom denied that he was a conservative, and asserted that what he sought to defend was the "theoretical life". Saul Bellow wrote <i>Ravelstein</i>, a roman à clef based on Bloom, his friend and colleague at the University of Chicago.

In conscious opposition to the idealist tradition of much of Western philosophy, his work often emphasized the corporeal nature of social life and stressed the role of practice and embodiment in social dynamics.  Building upon the theories of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Edmund Husserl, Georges Canguilhem, Karl Marx, Gaston Bachelard, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Erwin Panofsky, and Marcel Mauss (among others), his research pioneered novel investigative frameworks and methods, and introduced such influential concepts as cultural, social, and symbolic forms of capital (as opposed to traditional economic forms of capital), the cultural reproduction, the habitus, the field or location, and symbolic violence.   Another notable influence on Bourdieu was Blaise Pascal, after whom Bourdieu titled his <i>Pascalian Meditations</i>.  Bourdieu\'s major contributions to the sociology of education, the theory of sociology, and sociology of aesthetics have achieved wide influence in several related academic fields (e.g. anthropology, media and cultural studies, education), popular culture, and the arts.
</p><p>Bourdieu\'s best known book is <i>Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste</i> (1979). The book was judged the sixth most important sociological work of the twentieth century by the International Sociological Association. In it, Bourdieu argues that judgments of taste are related to social position, or more precisely, are themselves acts of social positioning.  His argument is put forward by an original combination of social theory and data from quantitative surveys, photographs and interviews, in an attempt to reconcile difficulties such as how to understand the subject within objective structures. In the process, he tried to reconcile the influences of both external social structures and subjective experience on the individual (see structure and agency).

He is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern philosophy.</p><p>During his career Derrida published more than 40 books, together with hundreds of essays and public presentations. He had a significant influence upon the humanities and social sciences, including — in addition to philosophy and literature — law, anthropology, historiography, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, political theory, religious studies, feminism, and gay and lesbian studies.
</p><p>His work retains major academic influence throughout continental Europe, South America and all other countries where "continental philosophy" has been predominant, particularly in debates around ontology, epistemology (especially concerning social sciences), ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and the philosophy of language. He also influenced architecture (in the form of deconstructivism), music, art, and art criticism.</p><p>Particularly in his later writings, Derrida addressed ethical and political themes in his work. Some critics consider <i>Speech and Phenomena</i> (1967) to be his most important work. Others cite <i>Of Grammatology, Writing and Difference</i>, and <i>Margins of Philosophy</i>. These writings influenced various activists and political movements. He became a well-known and influential public figure, while his approach to philosophy and the notorious incomprehensibility of his work made him controversial.</p>',

Educated at the University of Chicago and Yale University, he had strong interests and training in both the history of philosophy and contemporary analytic philosophy, the latter of which came to comprise the main focus of his work at Princeton University in the 1960s.  He subsequently came to reject the tradition of philosophy according to which knowledge involves correct representation (a "mirror of nature") of a world whose existence remains wholly independent of that representation. Rorty had a long and diverse academic career, including positions as Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University, Kenan Professor of Humanities at the University of Virginia, and Professor of Comparative Literature at Stanford University. Among his most influential books are <i>Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</i> (1979), <i>Consequences of Pragmatism</i> (1982), and <i>Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity</i> (1989).
</p><p>Rorty saw the idea of knowledge as a "mirror of nature" as pervasive throughout the history of western philosophy. Against this approach, Rorty advocated for a novel form of American pragmatism, sometimes called neopragmatism, in which scientific and philosophical methods form merely a set of contingent "vocabularies" which people abandon or adopt over time according to social conventions and usefulness. Abandoning representationalist accounts of knowledge and language, Rorty believed, would lead to a state of mind he referred to as "ironism," in which people become completely aware of the contingency of their placement in history and of their philosophical vocabulary. Rorty tied this brand of philosophy to the notion of "social hope"; he believed that without the representationalist accounts, and without metaphors between the mind and the world, human society would behave more peacefully. He also emphasized the reasons why the interpretation of culture as conversation (Bernstein 1971), constitutes the crucial concept of a "postphilosophical" culture determined to abandon representationalist accounts of traditional epistemology, incorporating American pragmatist naturalism that considers the natural sciences as an advance towards liberalism.

He is currently Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley. Widely noted for his contributions to the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and social philosophy, he began teaching at UC Berkeley in 1959.
</p><p>As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin, Searle was secretary of "Students against Joseph McCarthy". He received all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil, from the University of Oxford, where he held his first faculty positions. Later, at UC Berkeley, he became the first tenured professor to join the 1964–1965 Free Speech Movement. In the late 1980s, Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley\'s 1980 rent stabilization ordinance. Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court\'s "Searle Decision" of 1990, Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994.
</p><p>In 2000 Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind &amp; Brain Prize. Searle\'s early work on speech acts, influenced by J. L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein, helped establish his reputation. His notable concepts include the "Chinese room" argument against "strong" artificial intelligence. In March 2017, Searle was accused of sexual assault.

                'description' => '<p><b>Jerry Alan Fodor</b> (<span></span>; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist. He held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University and was the author of many works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, in which he laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, among other ideas. He was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation and as "one of the principal philosophers of mind of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. In addition to having exerted an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960, Fodor\'s work has had a significant impact on the development of the cognitive sciences."</p><p>Fodor argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.
</p><p>For Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or "organs", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the "central processing" part of the mind, which has a more global and less "domain specific" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.
</p><p>Although Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.

He is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and emeritus professor at Princeton University. Since the 1960s, Kripke has been a central figure in a number of fields related to mathematical logic, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics, epistemology, and set theory. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts. Kripke was the recipient of the 2001 Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.
</p><p>Kripke has made influential and original contributions to logic, especially modal logic. His work has profoundly influenced analytic philosophy; his principal contribution is a semantics for modal logic involving possible worlds, now called Kripke semantics. Another of his most important contributions is his argument that necessity is a "metaphysical" notion that should be separated from the epistemic notion of <i>a priori</i>, and that there are necessary truths that are <i>a posteriori</i> truths, such as that water is H<sub>2</sub>O. He has also contributed an original reading of Wittgenstein, referred to as "Kripkenstein." A 1970 Princeton lecture series, published in book form 1980 as <i>Naming and Necessity</i>, is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.

</p><p>Nancy\'s first book, published in 1973, was <i>Le titre de la lettre</i> (<i>The Title of the Letter</i>, 1992), a reading of the work of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, written in collaboration with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. Nancy is the author of works on many thinkers, including <i>La remarque spéculative</i> in 1973 (<i>The Speculative Remark</i>, 2001) on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, <i>Le Discours de la syncope</i> (1976) and <i>L’Impératif catégorique</i> (1983) on Immanuel Kant, <i>Ego sum</i> (1979) on René Descartes, and <i>Le Partage des voix</i> (1982) on Martin Heidegger. In addition to <i>Le titre de la lettre</i>, Nancy collaborated with Lacoue-Labarthe on several other books and articles. Major influences include Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, Georges Bataille, Maurice Blanchot and Friedrich Nietzsche.

<p><b>Derek Antony Parfit</b>, FBA (<span></span>; 11 December 1942 – 1 January 2017) was a British philosopher who specialised in personal identity, rationality, and ethics. He is widely considered one of the most important and influential moral philosophers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p><p>Parfit rose to prominence in 1971 with the publication of his first paper, "Personal Identity". His first book, <i>Reasons and Persons</i> (1984), has been described as the most significant work of moral philosophy since the 1800s. His second book, <i>On What Matters</i> (2011), was widely circulated and discussed for many years before its publication.
</p><p>For his entire academic career, Parfit worked at Oxford University, where he was an Emeritus Senior Research Fellow at All Souls College at the time of his death. He was also a visiting professor of philosophy at Harvard University, New York University, and Rutgers University. He was awarded 2014 Rolf Schock Prize "for his groundbreaking contributions concerning personal identity, regard for future generations, and analysis of the structure of moral theories."</p>',

<p><b>Peter Albert David Singer</b>, AC (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian moral philosopher. He is the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and a Laureate Professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne. He specialises in applied ethics and approaches ethical issues from a secular, utilitarian perspective. He is known in particular for his book <i>Animal Liberation</i> (1975), in which he argues in favour of vegetarianism, and his essay "Famine, Affluence, and Morality", in which he argues in favour of donating to help the global poor. For most of his career, he was a preference utilitarian, but he announced in <i>The Point of View of the Universe</i> (2014), coauthored with Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek, that he had become a hedonistic utilitarian.
</p><p>On two occasions, Singer served as chair of the philosophy department at Monash University, where he founded its Centre for Human Bioethics. In 1996 he stood unsuccessfully as a Greens candidate for the Australian Senate. In 2004 Singer was recognised as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. In 2005, the Sydney Morning Herald placed Singer among Australia\'s ten most influential public intellectuals. Singer is a cofounder of Animals Australia and the founder of The Life You Can Save.

He is a professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana  and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London. He works in subjects including continental philosophy, political theory, cultural studies, psychoanalysis, film criticism, Marxism, Hegelianism and theology.
</p><p>In 1989, Žižek published his first English text, <i>The Sublime Object of Ideology</i>, in which he departed from traditional Marxist theory to develop a materialist conception of ideology that drew heavily on Lacanian psychoanalysis and Hegelian idealism. His early theoretical work became increasingly eclectic and political in the 1990s, dealing frequently in the critical analysis of disparate forms of popular culture and making him a popular figure of the academic left. A critic of capitalism, neoliberalism and political correctness, Žižek calls himself a political radical, and his work has been characterized as challenging orthodoxies of both the political right and the social-liberal universities.</p><p>Žižek\'s idiosyncratic style, popular academic works, frequent magazine op-eds, and critical assimilation of high and low culture have gained him international influence, controversy, criticism and a substantial audience outside academe. In 2012, <i>Foreign Policy</i> listed Žižek on its list of Top 100 Global Thinkers, calling him "a celebrity philosopher" while elsewhere he has been dubbed the "Elvis of cultural theory" and "the most dangerous philosopher in the West". Žižek\'s work was chronicled in a 2005 documentary film entitled <i>Zizek!</i> A scholarly journal, the <i>International Journal of Žižek Studies</i>, was founded to engage his work.</p>',

The son of a Baptist minister, West focuses on the role of race, gender, and class in American society and the means by which people act and react to their "radical conditionedness." A radical democrat and democratic socialist, West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including Christianity, the black church, Marxism, neopragmatism, and transcendentalism. Among his most influential books are <i>Race Matters</i> (1994) and <i>Democracy Matters</i> (2004).
</p><p>West is an outspoken voice in left-wing politics in the United States, and as such has been critical of members of the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He has held professorships at Harvard University, Princeton University, Yale University, Pepperdine University, Union Theological Seminary, and the University of Paris during his career. He is also a frequent commentator on politics and social issues in many media outlets.</p><p>From 2010 through 2013, West co-hosted a radio program with Tavis Smiley, called <i>Smiley and West</i>. He has also been featured in several documentaries, and made appearances in Hollywood films such as <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i> and <i>The Matrix Revolutions</i>, providing commentary for both films. West has also made several spoken word and hip hop albums, and due to his work, has been named MTV\'s Artist of the Week. He has also been portrayed on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> by Kenan Thompson.</p>',

<p><b>Judith Butler</b> FBA is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics and the fields of third-wave feminist, queer and literary theory. Since 1993, she has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is now Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory. She is also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School.</p><p>Butler is best known for her books <i>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</i> (1990) and <i>Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex</i> (1993), in which she challenges conventional notions of gender and develops her theory of gender performativity. This theory has had a major influence on feminist and queer scholarship. Her works are often implemented in film studies courses emphasizing gender studies and the performativity in discourse.
</p><p>Butler has actively supported lesbian and gay rights movements and has spoken out on many contemporary political issues. In particular, she is a vocal critic of Zionism, Israeli politics and its effect on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, emphasizing that Israel does not and should not be taken to represent all Jews or Jewish opinion.</p>',

<p><b>Confucius</b> (<span></span> <i title="English pronunciation respelling">kən-<span>FEW</span>-shəs</i>; 551–479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.
</p><p>The philosophy of Confucius, also known as Confucianism, emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity. His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era only to be suppressed in favor of the Legalists during the Qin dynasty. Following the victory of Han over Chu after the collapse of Qin, Confucius\'s thoughts received official sanction and were further developed into a system known in the West as Neo-Confucianism, and later New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism).
</p><p>Confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the Chinese classic texts including all of the Five Classics, but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. Aphorisms concerning his teachings were compiled in the <i>Analects</i>, but only many years after his death.
</p><p>Confucius\'s principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty, ancestor veneration, and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives, recommending family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself", the Golden Rule. He is also a traditional deity in Daoism.
</p><p>Throughout history, Confucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in shaping the lives of humanity. His teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and still remain in today\'s society.</p><p><span id="Etymology"></span><span id="Name"></span><span id="Titles"></span>

Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of <i>The Art of War</i>, a widely influential work of military strategy that has affected both Western and East Asian philosophy and military thinking. Aside from his legacy as the author of <i>The Art of War</i>, Sun Tzu is revered in Chinese and East Asian culture as a legendary historical and military figure. His birth name was <b>Sun Wu</b>, and he was known outside of his family by his courtesy name <b>Changqing</b>. The name <i>Sun Tzu</i> by which he is best known in the Western World is an honorific which means "Master Sun".
</p><p>Sun Tzu\'s historicity is uncertain. The Han dynasty historian Sima Qian and other traditional Chinese historians placed him as a minister to King Helü of Wu and dated his lifetime to 544–496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity nonetheless place the existing text of <i>The Art of War</i> in the later Warring States period based upon its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare. Traditional accounts state that the general\'s descendant Sun Bin also wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled <i>The Art of War</i>. Since both Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin\'s treatise in 1972.
</p><p>Sun Tzu\'s work has been praised and employed throughout East Asian warfare since its composition. During the twentieth century, <i>The Art of War</i> grew in popularity and saw practical use in Western society as well. It continues to influence many competitive endeavors throughout the world, including culture, politics, business, and sports, as well as modern warfare.

Gaozi\'s teachings are no longer extant, but he was a contemporary of Mencius (ca. 372-289 BCE), and most of our knowledge about him comes from the <i>Mencius</i> book (6) titled "Gaozi".
</p><p>Warring States philosophers disputed whether human nature is originally good (Mencius) or evil (Xunzi). The "Gaozi" chapter begins with a famous metaphor about a type of willow tree (<i>qiliu</i> (杞柳). (Qi was also an ancient place name, best known through the four-character idiom <i>qirenyoutian</i> [杞人憂天, "person from Qi who worried heaven might fall"] "groundless fears; superfluous worry".)
</p>
<blockquote><p>The philosopher [Gao] said, \'Man\'s nature is like the [<i>qi</i>]-willow, and righteousness is like a cup or a bowl. The fashioning benevolence and righteousness out of man\'s nature is like the making cups and bowls from the [<i>qi</i>]-willow.\' </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Mencius replied, \'Can you, leaving untouched the nature of the willow, make with it cups and bowls? You must do violence and injury to the willow, before you can make cups and bowls with it. If you must do violence and injury to the willow in order to make cups and bowls with it, on your principles you must in the same way do violence and injury to humanity in order to fashion from it benevolence and righteousness! Your words, alas! would certainly lead all men on to reckon benevolence and righteousness to be calamities.\' </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The philosopher [Gao] said, \'Man\'s nature is like water whirling round in a corner. Open a passage for it to the east, and it will flow to the east; open a passage for it to the west, and it will flow to the west. Man\'s nature is indifferent to good and evil, just as the water is indifferent to the east and west.\' </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Mencius replied, \'Water indeed will flow indifferently to the east or west, but will it flow indifferently up or down? The tendency of man\'s nature to good is like the tendency of water to flow downwards. There are none but have this tendency to good, just as all water flows downwards. Now by striking water and causing it to leap up, you may make it go over your forehead, and, by damming and leading it you may force it up a hill - but are such movements according to the nature of water? It is the force applied which causes them. When men are made to do what is not good, their nature is dealt with in this way.\' (6A, tr. James Legge, 1895:394-396 [1])</p></blockquote>',

A book named after him, the <i>Mozi</i>, contains material ascribed to him and his followers.
</p><p>Born in what is now Tengzhou, Shandong Province, he founded the school of Mohism that argued strongly against Confucianism and Taoism. His philosophy emphasized self-restraint, self-reflection and authenticity rather than obedience to ritual. During the Warring States period, Mohism was actively developed and practiced in many states but fell out of favour when the legalist Qin dynasty came to power.  During that period, many Mohist classics are by many believed to have been ruined when the emperor Qin Shi Huang supposedly carried out the burning of books and burying of scholars. The importance of Mohism further declined when Confucianism became the dominant school of thought during the Han Dynasty, until mostly disappearing by the middle of the Western Han dynasty.</p><p>Mozi is known by children throughout Chinese culture by way of the <i>Thousand Character Classic</i>, which records that he was saddened when he saw dyeing of pure white silk, which embodied his conception of austerity (simplicity, chastity). For the modern juvenile audience of Chinese speakers, the image of his school and its founder were popularized by the animated TV series <i>The Legend of Qin</i>.
</p><p>The concept of Ai (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism\'s benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of "universal love" (jiān\'ài, 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in Chinese Buddhism, the term Ai (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, Ai was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

He also ran a school and enjoyed the support of rulers, and advocated peaceful means of resolving disputes in contrast to the wars which were common in the Warring States period. However, little is known about the particulars of his life, and furthermore many of his writings have been lost. All of his essays — fourteen originally but only six extant — are included in the anthology <i><b>the Gongsun Longzi</b></i> (Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hant">公孫龍子</span>; pinyin: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Gōngsūn lóng zi</span></i>; Wade–Giles: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kung-sun Lung-tzu</span></i>).
</p><p>In Book 17 of the <i>Zhuangzi</i> anthology, Gongsun thus speaks of himself:
</p>
<blockquote><p>When young, I studied the way of the former kings. When I grew up, I understood the practice of kindness and duty. I united the same and different, separated hard from white, made so the not-so and admissible the inadmissible. I confounded the wits of the hundred schools and exhausted the eloquence of countless speakers. I took myself to have reached the ultimate.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is best known for a series of paradoxes in the tradition of Hui Shi, including "White horses are not horses," "When no thing is not the pointed-out, to point out is not to point out," and "There is no 1 in 2." These paradoxes seem to suggest a similarity to the discovery in Greek philosophy that pure logic may lead to apparently absurd conclusions.

A contemporary of syncretist Shi Jiao and Legalist Shang Yang, he was born in the State of Zheng, and was likely a minor official there. After Han conquered Zheng in 375 BC, he rose up in the ranks of the Han officialdom, dividing up its territories and successfully reforming it. Though not dealing in penal law himself, his administrative innovations would be taken into "Chinese Legalist" statecraft by Han Fei, his most famous successor, and Shen Buhai\'s book most resembles the Han Feizi (though more conciliatory). He died of natural causes while in office.
</p><p>Though Chinese administration cannot be traced to any one individual, emphasizing a merit system figures like 4th century BC reformer Shen Buhai may have had more influence than any other, and might be considered its founder, if not valuable as a rare pre-modern example of abstract theory of administration. Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel sees in Shen Buhai the "seeds of the civil service examination", and, if one wished to exaggerate, the first political scientist, while the correlation between Shen\'s conception of the inactive (Wu-wei) ruler and the handling of claims and titles likely informed the Taoist conception of the formless Tao (name that cannot be named) that "gives rise to the ten thousand things."</p>',

In comparison with other Chinese philosophical giants, Yang Zhu has recently faded into relative obscurity, but his influence in his own time was so widespread that Mencius (孟子) described his philosophies along with the antithetical ideas of Mozi (墨子) as "floods and wild animals that ravage the land" (Liu: 1967: 358).

It comprises a selection of essays in the "Legalist" tradition on theories of state power, synthesizing the methodologies of his predecessors. Its 55 chapters, most of which date to the Warring States period mid-3rd century BC, are the only such text to survive intact. Easily one of the most important philosophical classics in ancient China, it touches on administration, diplomacy, war and economics, and is also valuable for its abundance of anecdotes about pre-Qin China. 
</p><p>Han Fei\'s writings were very influential on the future first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. After the early demise of the Qin dynasty, Han Fei\'s philosophy was officially vilified by the following Han Dynasty. Despite its outcast status throughout the history of imperial China, his political theory continued to heavily influence every dynasty thereafter, and the Confucian ideal of a rule without laws was never again realized. Shu Han\'s chancellor Zhuge Liang demanded emperor Liu Shan read the Han Feizi for learning the way of ruling.
</p><p>Though differing considerably in style, the coherency of the essays lend themselves to the possibility that they were written by Han Fei himself, and are generally considered more philosophically engaging than the Book of Lord Shang.</p>',

His contemporary rival was He Xiu (Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hans">何休</span>, 129-182).  Zheng is notable for his syncretic attempt to bridge the two centuries of rivalry between the two schools.  He adopted the strengths of each school in the interpretation of the Confucian classics although he usually favored the Old Text teachings.  He was very influential but the government never officially adopted his teachings. The Han Dynasty was already in decline during his lifetime and collapsed a generation after his death. Both schools did not survive the chaos but Zheng\'s conception of Confucianism would be the mainstream interpretation for centuries.
</p><p>In 200, during the Battle of Guandu, Zheng was ordered by the warlord Yuan Shao to Yuan\'s stronghold (in modern day Daming County, Hebei Province), where he died of illness in June.

He was a grandson of He Jin, a general and regent of the Eastern Han dynasty. His father, He Xian, died early, so his mother, Lady Yin, remarried the warlord Cao Cao. He Yan thus grew up as Cao Cao\'s stepson. He gained a reputation for intelligence and scholarship at an early age, but he was unpopular and criticised for being arrogant and dissolute. He was rejected for government positions by both emperors Cao Pi and Cao Rui, but became a minister during the rule of Cao Shuang. When the Sima family took control of the government in a <i>coup d\'état</i> in 249, he was executed along with all the other officials loyal to Cao Shuang.
</p><p>He Yan was, along with Wang Bi, one of the founders of the Daoist school of Xuanxue. He synthesised the philosophical schools of Daoism and Confucianism, believing that the two schools complimented each other. He wrote a famous commentary on the <i>Daode Jing</i> that was influential in his time, but no copies have survived. His commentary on the <i>Analects</i> was considered standard and authoritative for nearly 1000 years, until his interpretation was displaced by the commentary of Zhu Xi in the 14th century.

He developed a rational, secular, naturalistic and mechanistic account of the world and of human beings and gave a materialistic explanation of the origin of the universe. His main work was the <i>Lunheng</i> (論衡, "Critical Essays"). This book contained many theories involving early sciences of astronomy and meteorology, and Wang Chong was even the first in Chinese history to mention the use of the square-pallet chain pump, which became common in irrigation and public works in China thereafter. Wang also accurately described the process of the water cycle.
</p><p>Unlike most of the Chinese philosophers of his period, Wang spent much of his life in non-self-inflicted poverty. He was said to have studied by standing at bookstalls, and had a superb memory, which allowed him to become very well-versed in the Chinese classics. He eventually reached the rank of District Secretary, a post he soon lost as a result of his combative and anti-authoritarian nature.

He was also a scholar of xuanxue.
</p><p>The Guo Xiang redaction of the text revised a fifty-two chapter original by removing material he thought was superstitious and generally not of philosophical interest to his literati sensibilities, resulting in a thirty-three chapter total. He appended a philosophical commentary to the text that became famous, and within four centuries his shorter and snappier expurgated recension became the only one known.
</p><p>This <i>Zhuangzi</i> recension is traditionally divided into three sections: ‘Inner Chapters’ (1-7), ‘Outer Chapters’ (8-22), ‘Miscellaneous Chapters’ (23-33). This division is quite old and is likely to have been part of the original recension.
</p><p>Guo\'s redaction focuses on his understanding of Zhuangzi\'s philosophy of spontaneity (Chinese: <span lang="zh">自然</span>; pinyin: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">zìrán</span></i>; Wade–Giles: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-wadegile"><i>tzu jan</i></span></i>; literally "self so"). This practiced spontaneity is demonstrated by the story of Cook Ding, rendered as Cook Ting in the Burton Watson translation (which is itself ultimately derived from the Guo Xiang recension):
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>Cook Ting was cutting up an ox for Lord Wen-hui. At every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee, zip! zoop! He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Ching-shou Music.
</p><p>"Ah, this is marvelous!" said Lord Wen-hui. "Imagine skill reaching such heights!"
</p><p>Cook Ting laid down his knife and replied, "What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years I no longer saw the whole ox. And now I go at it by spirit and don\'t look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and follow things as they are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint."
</p><p>"A good cook changes his knife once a year, because he cuts. A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month, because he hacks. I\'ve had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I\'ve cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there\'s plenty of room, more than enough for the blade to play about it. That\'s why after nineteen years the blade of my knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone.
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here, the careful yet effortlessly spontaneous way in which Cook Ding is described cutting up the ox is both an example of the cognitive state of mind Zhuangzi associated with the Tao and the assertion that this state is accessible in everyday life.

was a Chinese Buddhist philosopher from Later Qin around 384-417 at Chang\'an.
Born to a poor family in Jingzhao, he acquired literary skills, apparently including the capacity to read Pali, and became a scribe. This exposed him to a variety of uncommon documents. He was influenced by Taoists, Laozi and Zhuangzi., and although we are told he enjoyed Lao Tzu’s <i>Dotokyu-kyo</i> (Tao-te ching), he was overjoyed when he discovered the <i>Vimalakirti Sutra.</i> This encounter transformed his life and he became a Buddhist. He was known as being among the ablest of the disciples of Kumārajīva.</p><p>Seng-Chao (also known as <i>Sojo</i>) was recognized as a both a scholar of high skill and someone of profound understanding relating to religious matters. He was involved in translating Indian treatises, which formed the only source of study for early Chinese Mādhyamika Buddhism. He also authored a small number of texts, but is famous for the book <i>Zhaolun</i>. Its chapters are as follows: <i>Things Do Not Shift</i>, <i>Non-Absolute Emptiness</i>, <i>Prajna Is Without Dichotomizing Knowledge</i>, and <i>Nirvana Is Without Conceptualization</i>.</p><p>He is mentioned in the <i>Memoirs of Eminent Monks</i>.
</p><p>Sengzhao criticized earlier Chinese Buddhist schools for believing in being or non-being. He concluded that all dharmas are empty.</p>',

His standard title was Śramaṇa Zhiyi (Ch. 沙門智顗), linking him to the broad tradition of Indian asceticism. Zhiyi is famous for being the first in the history of Chinese Buddhism to elaborate a complete, critical and systematic classification of the Buddhist teachings. He is also regarded as the first major figure to make a significant break from the Indian tradition, to form an indigenous Chinese system.

He was said to have been an uneducated layman who suddenly attained awakening upon hearing the Diamond Sutra. Despite his lack of formal training, he demonstrated his understanding to the fifth patriarch, Daman Hongren, who then supposedly chose Huineng as his true successor instead of his publicly known selection of Yuquan Shenxiu. Twentieth century scholarship revealed that the story of Huineng\'s Buddhist career was likely invented by the monk Heze Shenhui, who claimed to be one of Huineng\'s disciples and was highly critical of Shenxiu\'s teaching. Huineng is regarded as the founder of the "Sudden Enlightenment" Southern Chan school of Buddhism, which focuses on an immediate and direct attainment of Buddhist enlightenment. The <i>Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch</i> (<span lang="zh-Hant">六祖壇經</span>), which is said to be a record of his teachings, is a highly influential text in the East Asian Buddhist tradition.

He was an important and influential philosopher, so much so that it has been claimed that he "was in fact the real creator of what is now known as Hua-yen." Fazang\'s ancestors came from Sogdia, a major center for trade along the Silk Road (modern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan), but he was born in the Tang capital of Chang\'an (now Xi\'an), where his family had become culturally Chinese.
</p><p>In his youth, Fazang assisted Xuanzang in translating Buddhist works from Sanskrit into Chinese, but later became a disciple of Zhiyan, the second patriarch of the Huayan school. Another disciple of Zhiyan during the same period was the Korean Buddhist Uisang, who went on to found Hwaeom, the Korean branch of Huayan. Fazang and Uisang became good friends, and after Uisang returned to Korea, Fazang wrote him a letter expressing his admiration and affection.  One of the major intellectual influences on Fazang was the <i>Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana</i>, particularly its doctrine of the <i>tathagatagarbha</i> "womb of the Buddha", and his commentary on it "has been accepted as the final authority for a correct understanding of the text." In interpreting <i>The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana,</i> Fazang frequently quotes with approval the interpretation of the Korean Buddhist Wonhyo.  Many scholars have also observed the influence of Taoism on Chinese Buddhism in general and Fazang\'s thought in particular. Finally, some claim that Fazang drew inspiration from the <i>Yijing</i>.</p><p>Fazang is said to have authored over a hundred volumes of essays and commentaries, but two of his works in particular are among the most celebrated Huayan texts:  "On the Golden Lion" and "The Rafter Dialogue."  The former essay is based on a lecture on Buddhism that Fazang gave to Empress Wu Zetian. The Empress was having trouble understanding the subtle views of Huayan, so Fazang drew an analogy, comparing the relationship between the shape of a lion statue and the gold of which it is composed to the relationship between the conditioned things that exist and the underlying reality of which all are a part.  "On the Golden Lion" may be found in the Taishō Tripiṭaka, where it is text 1881, and is accompanied by the Song dynasty commentary of Cheng Qian. In <i>The Rafter Dialogue</i>, Fazang defends the doctrine of the interdependent existence of all entities, using the relationship between a rafter and the other parts of a building as an analogy. <i>The Rafter Dialogue</i> is a portion of a longer, systematic treatise, <i>Paragraphs on the Doctrine of Difference and Identity of the One Vehicle of Huayan</i> (Chinese: <span lang="zh">華嚴一乘教分齊章</span>), which may be found in the Taishō Tripiṭaka, where it is text 1866.

His philosophy was dualistic (between all that is tangible and all that is intangible) and pantheistic (believing that all that is intangible is the same thing, such as god, the human nature, feelings, actions (we see things acting, but not the action itself), movement (likewise), social roles and relations (likewise), chance, etc., and that such a unified, universal principle is <i><b>in</b></i> everything that is sensible [rather than in an external reality as in Platonism]); among his quotes are "outside <i>dao</i> there are no things and outside things there is no <i>dao</i>", "we call it god to emphasize the wonderful mystery of principle in ten thousand things, just as we call it lord (<i>di</i>) to characterize its being the ruler of events" and "in terms of the reality, it is change; in terms of principle, it is <i>dao</i>; in terms of its function, it is god; in terms of its destiny in a human being, it is human nature".</p>',

He conceptualized the Neo-Confucian cosmology of the day, explaining the relationship between human conduct and universal forces. In this way, he emphasizes that humans can master their <i>qi</i> ("vital life energy") in order to accord with nature. He was a major influence to Zhu Xi, who was the architect of Neo-Confucianism.  Zhou Dunyi was mainly concerned with Taiji (supreme polarity) and Wuji (limitless potential), the yin and yang, and the wu xing (the five phases).  He is also venerated and credited in Taoism as the first philosopher to popularize the concept of the taijitu or "yin-yang symbol".

His father and his grandfather had been government officials, but, although Zhang achieved the highest civil service examination degree in 1778, he never held high office. Zhang\'s ideas about the historical process were revolutionary in many ways and he became one of the most enlightened historical theorists of the Qing dynasty, but he spent much of his life in near poverty without the support of a patron and, in 1801, he died, poor and with few friends. It was not until the late 19th century that Chinese scholars began to accept the validity of Zhang\'s ideas.</p>

<p>His biographer, David Nivison comments that while his countrymen did not think him a great literary artist, "the infrequent western reader will find his style often both moving and powerful." Zhang developed, Nivison continues, "an organic view of history and the state that approaches Hegelian thought, and then built this view upon and into a theory of culture that sometimes suggests Vico," the Italian philosopher.</p><p>His magnum opus, <i>On Literature and History</i> (《文史通義》), was published posthumously, in 1832.  In Zhang\'s view, Confucianism developed over time in response to the concrete needs of the people for social organization.  This developmental view contrasts with the view of the Neo-Confucians that Confucianism is the expression of timeless "principles" or "patterns" that are inherent in the human heart.  Zhang\'s most famous quotation is that "the six classics are all history" 六經皆史.  This means that the canonical texts of Confucianism are not to be understood as repositories of timeless wisdom, but as records of the actions and words of the sages in response to specific historical contexts.</p>',

Through his connections, he became close to the young emperor and fervently encouraged the young monarch to promote his friends and consequently soured the relationship between the emperor and his adoptive mother, the empress dowager Cixi. He was an ardent Chinese nationalist and internationalist. His ideas inspired a reformation movement that  was thought to be supported by the weak Guangxu Emperor and, more cautiously, by the powerful Empress Dowager Cixi. Although he continued to advocate a constitutional monarchy after the founding of the Republic, Kang\'s political theory was never put into practice as he was forced to flee China for constantly attempting to assassinate the empress dowager. He fled to Japan where he gave false informations and negative impressions of the empress dowager Cixi.</p>',

<p><b>Sun Yat-sen</b> (<span></span>; 12 November 1866 – 12 March 1925) was the founding father of the Republic of China. The first provisional president of the Republic of China, Sun was a Chinese medical doctor, writer, philosopher, Georgist, calligrapher and revolutionary. As the foremost pioneer and first leader of a Republican China, Sun is referred to as the "Father of the Nation" in the Republic of China (ROC) and the "forerunner of democratic revolution" in the People\'s Republic of China (PRC). Sun played an instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty (the last imperial dynasty of China) during the years leading up to the Xinhai Revolution. He was appointed to serve as Provisional President of the Republic of China when it was founded in 1912. He later co-founded the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party of China), serving as its first leader. Sun was a uniting figure in post-Imperial China, and he remains unique among 20th-century Chinese politicians for being widely revered amongst the people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</p><p>Although Sun is considered to be one of the greatest leaders of modern China, his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile. After the success of the revolution and the Han Chinese regaining power after 268 years of living under Manchurian rule (Qing dynasty), he quickly resigned from his post as President of the newly founded Republic of China to Yuan Shikai, and led successive revolutionary governments as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation. Sun did not live to see his party consolidate its power over the country during the Northern Expedition. His party, which formed a fragile alliance with the Chinese Communist Party, split into two factions after his death.
</p><p>Sun\'s chief legacy resides in his developing of the political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People: nationalism (Han Chinese nationalism: independence from imperialist domination – taking back power from the Manchurian Qing dynasty), “rights of the people,” sometimes translated as “democracy,” and the people\'s livelihood (just society).</p>',

A versatile scholar, he made great contributions to mathematics, geography, phonology and philosophy. His philosophical and philological critiques of Neo-Confucianism continue to be influential.
</p><p>Dai\'s philosophical contributions included those to the Han Learning school of Evidential Learning (Evidentialism) which criticized the Song Learning school of Neo-Confucianism. In particular, two criticisms that Dai made was: First, Neo-Confucianism focused too much on introspective self-examination whereas truth was to be found in investigation of the external world.
</p><p>Second, he criticized the Neo-Confucian drive to eliminate human desire as an obstacle to rational investigation. Dai argued that human desire was a good and integral part of the human experience, and that eliminating human desire from philosophy had the bad effect of making it difficult to understand and control one\'s emotions as well as making it impossible to establish empathy with others.

He was one of the "Six gentlemen of the Hundred Days\' Reform" (戊戌六君子). He occupies a place of tremendous importance in modern Chinese history. To many contemporaries, his execution symbolised the political failure of Qing Dynasty\'s reformation from within itself and turned the intellectual class to seek violent and hostile means, through revolution, to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.

</p><p>Xiong is widely regarded as the thinker who laid down the basis for the revival of Confucianism during the twentieth century, and the main voice in contemporary Chinese philosophy who called for a revival of the Confucian dao. He felt it could provide a guide for the country during its tumultuous period following the May Fourth Movement in 1919. He felt that national survival was predicated on a sense of community, which in turn could only come from trusting commitments from the people involved. He believed that the most urgent task for the educated elite in China was to raise the cultural awareness and sensitivity of the people that the clash between the West and China was not solely a clash of economic strength and military might, but also a conflict between basic human values. While he led a fairly secluded life throughout his career as a teacher and his association with the academic community did not begin until he was in his late thirties, his views have influenced scholars to this day.

Liu disappeared from public life in 1968 and was labelled the "commander of China\'s bourgeoisie headquarters", China\'s foremost "capitalist-roader", and a traitor to the revolution.

<p><b>Mao Zedong</b> (December 26, 1893 – September 9, 1976), commonly known as <b>Chairman Mao</b>, was a Chinese communist revolutionary who became the founding father of the People\'s Republic of China, which he ruled as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. His theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism.
</p><p>Mao was the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan. He had a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. He later adopted Marxism–Leninism while working at Peking University, and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers\' and Peasants\' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet\'s radical land policies, and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), China\'s civil war resumed after Japan\'s surrender and in 1949 Mao\'s forces defeated the Nationalist government, which withdrew to Taiwan.
</p><p>On October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People\'s Republic of China (PRC), a single-party state controlled by the CPC. In the following years he solidified his control through land reforms and through a psychological victory in the Korean War, as well as through campaigns against landlords, people he termed "counter-revolutionaries", and other perceived enemies of the state. In 1957 he launched a campaign known as the Great Leap Forward that aimed to rapidly transform China\'s economy from agrarian to industrial. This campaign led to the deadliest famine in history and the deaths of an estimated minimum of 45 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1966, Mao initiated the Cultural Revolution, a program to remove "counter-revolutionary" elements in Chinese society that lasted 10 years and was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of Mao\'s personality cult. It is now officially regarded as a "severe setback" for the PRC.) In 1972, Mao welcomed American President Richard Nixon in Beijing, signalling the start of a policy of opening China to the world. After years of ill health, he suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. He was succeeded as paramount leader by Premier Hua Guofeng, who was quickly sidelined and replaced by Deng Xiaoping.
</p><p>A controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important and influential individuals in modern world history. He is also known as a political intellect, theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary. Supporters credit him with driving imperialism out of China, modernising the nation and building it into a world power, promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, as well as increasing life expectancy as China\'s population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million under his leadership. Conversely, his regime has been called autocratic and totalitarian, and condemned for bringing about mass repression and destroying religious and cultural artifacts and sites. It was additionally responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 30 to 70 million victims.</p>',

) was an ancient Sanskrit philologist, grammarian, and a revered scholar in ancient India. Considered the father of Indian linguistics, Pāṇini likely lived in the northwest Indian subcontinent during the Mahajanapada era. He is said to have been born in what is now Pakistan, in Shalatula near Attock, not far from Taxila, in what was then a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley, which technically made him in all probability a Persian subject.</p><p>Pāṇini is known for his text <i>Ashtadhyayi</i>, a sutra-style treatise on Sanskrit grammar, 3,959 "verses" or rules on linguistics, syntax and semantics in "eight chapters" which is the foundational text of the <i>Vyākaraṇa</i> branch of the Vedanga, the auxiliary scholarly disciplines of the Vedic period. His aphoristic text attracted numerous <i>bhashya</i> (commentaries), of which Patanjali\'s <i>Mahābhāṣya</i> is the most famous in Hindu traditions. His ideas influenced and attracted commentaries from scholars of other Indian religions such as Buddhism.</p><p>Pāṇini\'s analysis of noun compounds still forms the basis of modern linguistic theories of compounding in Indian languages. Pāṇini\'s comprehensive and scientific theory of grammar is conventionally taken to mark the start of Classical Sanskrit. His systematic treatise inspired and made Sanskrit the preeminent Indian language of learning and literature for two millennia.</p><p>Pāṇini\'s theory of morphological analysis was more advanced than any equivalent Western theory before the 20th century. His treatise is generative and descriptive, and has been compared to the Turing machine wherein the logical structure of any computing device has been reduced to its essentials using an idealized mathematical model.</p>
<p>The name Pāṇini is a patronymic meaning descendant of <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Paṇina</i>. His full name was "Dakṣiputra Pāṇini" according to verses 1.75.13 and 3.251.12 of Patanjali\'s <i>Mahābhāṣya</i>, with the first part suggesting his mother\'s name was Dakṣi.</p>

<p><b>Gautama Buddha</b> (c. 563/480 – c. 483/400 BCE), also known as <b>Siddhārtha Gautama</b>, <b>Shakyamuni</b> (i.e. "Sage of the Shakyas") <b>Buddha</b>, or simply the <b>Buddha</b>, after the title of <i>Buddha</i>, was a monk (śramaṇa), mendicant, and sage, on whose teachings Buddhism was founded. He is believed to have lived and taught mostly in the northeastern part of ancient India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE.</p><p>Gautama taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the śramaṇa movement common in his region. He later taught throughout other regions of eastern India such as Magadha and Kosala.</p><p>Gautama is the primary figure in Buddhism. He is believed by Buddhists to be an enlightened teacher who attained full Buddhahood and shared his insights to help sentient beings end rebirth and suffering. Accounts of his life, discourses and monastic rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarised after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to him were passed down by oral tradition and first committed to writing about 400 years later.
</p><p>In Vaishnava Hinduism, the historic Buddha is considered to be an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. Of the ten major avatars of Vishnu, Vaishnavites believe Gautama Buddha to be the ninth and most recent incarnation.</p>',

</p>
<p><b>Mahavira</b> (IAST: <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Mahāvīra</i>, <span></span>;), also known as <b>Vardhamāna</b>, was the twenty-fourth <i>Tirthankara</i> (ford-maker) of Jainism. In the Jain tradition, it is believed that Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th<span> </span>century BC into a royal kshatriya family in what is now Bihar, India. At the age of 30 he abandoned all worldly possessions and left home in pursuit of spiritual awakening, eventually becoming an ascetic. For the next 12 years, Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities, after which he is believed to have attained <i>Kevala Jnana</i> (omniscience). He preached for 30 years, and is believed by Jains to have died in the 6th<span> </span>century BC, though the year varies by the Jain sect. Scholars such as Karl Potter consider his biographical details as uncertain, with some suggesting he lived in the 5th<span> </span>century BC contemporaneously with the Buddha. Mahavira died at the age of 72, and his remains were cremated.</p><p>After he gained <i>Kevala Jnana</i>, Mahavira taught that observing the vows <i>ahimsa</i> (non-violence), <i>satya</i> (truth), <i>asteya</i> (non-stealing), <i>brahmacharya</i> (chastity), and <i>aparigraha</i> (non-attachment) is necessary to spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of <i>Anekantavada</i> (many-sided reality), <i>Syadvada</i> and <i>Nayavada</i>. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called <i>Jain Agamas</i>. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st<span> </span>century when they were first written down. The surviving versions of the <i>Agamas</i> taught by Mahavira are some of the foundational texts of Jainism.
</p><p>Mahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture with the symbol of a lion beneath him. The earliest iconography for Mahavira is from archaeological sites in the north Indian city of Mathura. These are variously dated from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. The day he was born is celebrated as <i>Mahavir Janma-kalyanak</i> (popularly known as Mahavir Jayanti), and the day of his death is observed by Jains as Diwali.</p>',

<p><b>Jaimini</b> was an ancient Indian scholar who founded the Mimansa school of Hindu philosophy. He was a disciple of sage Veda Vyasa, the son of Parashara. Traditionally attributed to be the author of the <i>Mimamsa Sutras</i>  and <i>Jaimini Sutras</i>, he is estimated to have lived around the 4th-century BCE. His school is considered non-theistic, but one that emphasized rituals parts of the Vedas as essential to Dharma.</p><p>Jaimini\'s guru was Badarayana, the latter founded the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, emphasizing the knowledge parts of the Vedas, and credited with authoring Brahma Sutras. Both Badarayana and Jaimini quoted each other as they analyzed each other\'s theories, Badarayana emphasizing knowledge while Jaimini emphasizes rituals, sometimes agreeing with each other, sometimes disagreeing, often anti-thesis of the other.</p><p>Jaimini\'s contributions to textual analysis and exegesis influenced other schools of Indian philosophies, and the most studied bhasya (reviews and commentaries) on Jaimini\'s texts were by scholars named Shabara, Kumarila and Prabhakara.</p>',

<p>The <i><b>Nyāya Sūtras</b></i> is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by <b><i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Akṣapāda Gautama</i></b>, and the foundational text of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown, but variously estimated between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE. The text may have been composed by more than one author, over a period of time. The text consists of five books, with two chapters in each book, with a cumulative total of 528 aphoristic sutras, about rules of reason, logic, epistemology and metaphysics.</p><p>The Nyāya Sūtras is a Hindu text, notable for focusing on knowledge and logic, and making no mention of Vedic rituals. The first book is structured as a general introduction and table of contents of sixteen categories of knowledge. Book two is about <i>pramana</i> (epistemology), book three is about <i>prameya</i> or the objects of knowledge, and the text discusses the nature of knowledge in remaining books. It set the foundation for Nyaya tradition of the empirical theory of validity and truth, opposing uncritical appeals to intuition or scriptural authority.</p><p>The Nyaya sutras cover a wide range of topics, including Tarka-Vidyā, the science of debate or Vāda-Vidyā, the science of discussion. The <i>Nyāya Sutras</i> are related to but extend the <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Vaiśeṣika</i> epistemological and metaphysical system. Later commentaries expanded, expounded and discussed Nyaya sutras, the earlier surviving commentaries being by Vātsyāyana (c.450–500 CE), followed by the <i>Nyāyavārttika</i> of Uddyotakāra (c. 6th–7th centuries), Vācaspati Miśra\'s <i>Tātparyatīkā</i> (9th century), Udayana\'s <i>Tātparyapariśuddhi</i> (10th century), and Jayanta\'s <i>Nyāyamañjarī</i> (10th century).</p>',

He authored many Jain texts such as: <i>Samayasara, Niyamasara, Pancastikayasara, Pravachanasara, Atthapahuda</i> and <i>Barasanuvekkha</i>. He occupies the highest place in the tradition of the Digambara Jain acharyas, a position comparable to Christ in Christianity and Muhammad in Islam. All Digambara Jains say his name before starting to read the scripture.

<p><b>Umaswami</b>, also known as <b>Umaswati</b>, was an early 1st-millennium Indian scholar, possibly between 2nd-century and 5th-century CE, known for his foundational writings on Jainism. He authored the Jain text <i>Tattvartha Sutra</i> (literally \'"All That Is", also called <i>Tattvarthadhigama Sutra</i>). Umaswati\'s work was the first Sanskrit language text on Jain philosophy, and is the earliest extant comprehensive Jain philosophy text accepted as authoritative by all four Jain traditions. His text has the same importance in Jainism as <i>Vedanta Sutras</i> and <i>Yogasutras</i> have in Hinduism.</p><p>Umaswati is claimed by both the Digambara and Śvētāmbara sects of Jainism as their own. On the basis of his genealogy, he was also called <i>Nagaravachka</i>. Umaswati was influential not only in Jainism, but also other Indian traditions over the centuries. The 13th- to 14th-century Madhvacharya, founder of Dvaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, for example referred to Umaswati in his works as <i>Umasvati-Vachakacharya</i>. Some in the Digambara Jain tradition believe him to be the chief disciple of Acharya Kundakunda. However, this is disputed by some Western scholars.</p><p>Umaswati, also spelled <b>Umasvati</b>, was an <i>Acharya</i> (head of the monastic order, teacher) and therefore one of the <i>Pañca-Parameṣṭhi</i> (five supreme beings) in Jaina tradition. The theory mooted by Umaswati is that rebirth and suffering is on account of one\'s <i>karma</i> (deeds)  and a life lived in accordance to vows of virtuous living with austerities cleanses this <i>karma</i>, ultimately leading to liberation. The main philosophy in Umaswati\'s <i>Tatvartha Sutra</i> aphorisms is that "all life, both human and non-human, is sacred."</p>',

Vasubandhu was a philosopher who wrote on the Abhidharma from the perspectives of the Sarvastivada and Sautrāntika schools. Along with his half-brother Asanga, he was also one of the main founders of the Yogacara school after his conversion to Mahayana Buddhism.
</p><p>Vasubandhu\'s <i>Abhidharmakośakārikā</i> ("Commentary on the Treasury of the Abhidharma") is widely used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism as the major source for non-Mahayana Abhidharma philosophy. His philosophical verse works set forth the standard for the Indian Yogacara metaphysics of "appearance only" (<i>vijñapti-mātra</i>), which has been described as a form of "epistemological idealism",  phenomenology and close to Immanuel Kant\'s transcendental idealism. Apart from this, he wrote several commentaries, works on logic,  argumentation and devotional poetry.
</p><p>Vasubandhu is one of the most influential thinkers in the Indian Buddhist philosophical tradition. In Jōdo Shinshū, he is considered the Second Patriarch and in Chan Buddhism, he is the 21st Patriarch.

<p><b>Bodhidharma </b>  was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century. He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, and regarded as its first Chinese patriarch. According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the monks of Shaolin Monastery that led to the creation of Shaolin kungfu. In Japan, he is known as <b>Daruma</b>.
</p><p>Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend and unreliable details.</p><p>According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, which refers to Central Asia but may also include the Indian subcontinent, and was either a "Persian Central Asian" or a "South Indian [...] the third son of a great Indian king."
Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as an ill-tempered, profusely-bearded, wide-eyed non-Chinese person. He is referred as "The Blue-Eyed Barbarian" (Chinese: <span lang="zh">碧眼胡</span>; pinyin: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Bìyǎnhú</span></i>) in Chan texts.</p><p>Aside from the Chinese accounts, several popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma\'s origins.</p><p>The accounts also differ on the date of his arrival, with one early account claiming that he arrived during the Liu Song dynasty (420–479) and later accounts dating his arrival to the Liang dynasty (502–557). Bodhidharma was primarily active in the territory of the Northern Wei (386-634). Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century.</p><p>Bodhidharma\'s teachings and practice centered on meditation and the <i>Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra</i>. The <i>Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall</i> (952) identifies Bodhidharma as the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in an uninterrupted line that extends all the way back to the Gautama Buddha himself.</p>

<p><b>Bhartṛhari</b> (Devanagari: <span lang="sa" title="Sanskrit language text">भर्तृहरि</span>; also romanised as <b>Bhartrihari</b>; fl. c. 5th century CE) is a Sanskrit writer to whom are normally ascribed two influential Sanskrit texts:
</p>
<ul><li>the <i>Vākyapadīya</i>, on Sanskrit grammar and linguistic philosophy, a foundational text in the Indian grammatical tradition, explaining numerous theories on the word and on the sentence, including theories which came to be known under the name of Sphoṭa; in this work Bhartrhari also discussed logical problems such as the liar paradox and a paradox of unnameability or unsignfiability which has become known as Bhartrhari\'s paradox, and</li>
<li>the <i>Śatakatraya</i>, a work of Sanskrit poetry, comprising three collections of about 100 stanzas each; it may or may not be by the same author who composed the two mentioned grammatical works.</li></ul><p>In the medieval tradition of Indian scholarship, it was assumed that both texts were written by the same person. 
Modern philologists were sceptical of this claim, owing to an argument that dated the grammar to a date subsequent to the poetry. Since the 1990s, however, scholars have agreed that both works may indeed have been contemporary, in which case it is plausible that there was only one Bhartrihari who wrote both texts.</p><p>Both the grammar and the poetic works had an enormous influence in their respective fields. 
The grammar in particular, takes a holistic view of language, countering the compositionality position of the Mimamsakas and others.
</p><p>The poetry constitute short verses, collected into three centuries of about a hundred poems each.  Each century deals with a different rasa or aesthetic mood; on the whole his poetic work has been very highly regarded both within the tradition and by modern scholarship.
</p><p>The name Bhartrihari is also sometimes associated with Bhartrihari traya Shataka, the legendary king of Ujjaini in the 1st century.

<p><b>Dignāga</b> (a.k.a. <i>Diṅnāga</i>, c. 480 – c. 540 CE) was an Indian Buddhist scholar and one of the Buddhist founders of Indian logic (<i>hetu vidyā</i>). Dignāga\'s work laid the groundwork for the development of deductive logic in India and created the first system of Buddhist logic and epistemology (Pramana).</p><p>According to Georges B Dreyfus, his philosophical school brought about an Indian "epistemological turn" and became the "standard formulation of Buddhist logic and epistemology in India and Tibet." Dignāga\'s thought influenced later Buddhist philosophers like Dharmakirti and also Hindu thinkers of the Nyaya school. Dignāga\'s epistemology accepted only "perception" (pratyaksa) and "inference" (anumāṇa) are valid instruments of knowledge and introduced the widely influential theory of "exclusion" (<i>apoha</i>) to explain linguistic meaning. His work on language, inferential reasoning and perception were also widely influential among later Indian philosophers. According to Richard P. Hayes "some familiarity with Dinnaga\'s arguments and conclusions is indispensable for anyone who wishes to understand the historical development of Indian thought."</p><p>Dignāga was born in Simhavakta near Kanchipuram and very little is known of his early years, except that he took as his spiritual preceptor Nagadatta of the Pudgalavada school before being expelled and becoming a student of Vasubandhu.</p>',

<p><b><i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Kumārila Bhaṭṭa</i></b> (fl. roughly 700) was a Hindu philosopher and Mīmāṃsā scholar from present-day India. He is famous for many of his various theses on Mimamsa, such as <i>Mimamsaslokavarttika</i>. Bhaṭṭa was a staunch believer in the supreme validity of Vedic injunction, a great champion of Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā and a confirmed ritualist. The <i>Varttika</i> is mainly written as a subcommentary of Sabara\'s commentary on Jaimini\'s Purva Mimamsa Sutras. His philosophy is classified by some scholars as existential realism.</p><p>Scholars differ as regards Kumārila Bhaṭṭa\'s views on a personal God. For example, Manikka Vachakar believed that Bhaṭṭa promoted a personal God (saguna brahman), which conflicts with the Mīmāṃsā school. In his <i>Varttika</i>, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa goes to great lengths to argue against the theory of a creator God and held that the actions enjoined in the Veda had definite results without an external interference.
</p><p>Bhaṭṭa is also credited with the logical formulation of the Mimamsic belief that the Vedas are unauthored (apauruṣeyā). In particular, his defence against medieval Buddhist positions on Vedic rituals is noteworthy. Some believe that this contributed to the decline of Buddhism in India, because his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline. Indeed, his dialectical success against Buddhists is confirmed by Buddhist historian Taranatha, who reports that Bhaṭṭa defeated disciples of Buddhapalkita, Bhavya, Dharmadasa, Dignaga and others. His work strongly influenced other schools of Indian philosophy, with the exception that while Mimamsa considers the Upanishads to be subservient to the Vedas, the Vedanta school does not think so.

</p>
<p><b>Udayana</b>, also known as <b>Udayanācārya</b> (<b>Udyanacharya</b>, or <b>Master Udayana</b>), was a very important Hindu logician of the tenth century who attempted to reconcile the views held by the two major schools of logic (Nyaya and  Vaisheshika). This became the root of the Navya-Nyāya school of the thirteenth century, established by the Gangesha Upadhyaya ("New Nyāya") school of "right" reasoning, which is still recognized and followed in some regions of India.  He lived in Kariyan village in  Mithila, near present-day Darbhanga, Bihar state, India.
</p><p>Udayana wrote a sub-gloss on Vachaspati\'s work called the Nyaya-vaartika-taatparya-tiikaa-parishuddhi. He wrote several other works such as the Kusumanjali, Atma-tattva-viveka, Kiranaavali and Nyaya-parishishhta (also called Bodha siddhi or Bodha shuddhi).
</p><p>He is given credit by Naiyâyikas for having demolished in a final fashion the claims of the Buddhist logicians. All his works, or at least all of which we know, have been preserved, which attest to the respect in which he was held from the beginning.

The text consists of four chapters (also called four books), of which Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology thereby showing it was influenced by Buddhism. However, doctrinally Gaudapada\'s work is Vedantin, and not Buddhist. The first three chapters of  Gaudapada\'s text have been influential in the Advaita Vedanta tradition.  Parts of the first chapter that include the <i>Mandukya Upanishad</i> have been considered a valid scriptural source by the Dvaita and Vishistadvaita schools of Vedanta, but nothing from chapter four with Buddhist flavor has found acceptance or use in the Vedanta school of Hinduism.</p>',

<p><b>Adi Shankara</b> (pronounced <small></small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[aːd̪i ɕəŋkəɾə]</span>) or Shankara, was an early 8th century Indian philosopher and theologian who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta.  He is credited with unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism.</p><p>His works in Sanskrit discuss the unity of the ātman and Nirguna Brahman "brahman without attributes". He wrote copious commentaries on the Vedic canon (<i>Brahma Sutras</i>, Principal Upanishads and <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>) in support of his thesis. His works elaborate on ideas found in the Upanishads. Shankara\'s publications criticised the ritually-oriented Mīmāṃsā school of Hinduism. He also explained the key difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, stating that Hinduism asserts "Atman (Soul, Self) exists", while Buddhism asserts that there is "no Soul, no Self".</p><p>Shankara travelled across the Indian subcontinent to propagate his philosophy through discourses and debates with other thinkers. He established the importance of monastic life as sanctioned in the Upanishads and Brahma Sutra, in a time when the Mīmāṃsā school established strict ritualism and ridiculed monasticism. He is reputed to have founded four mathas ("monasteries"), which helped in the historical development, revival and spread of Advaita Vedanta of which he is known as the greatest revivalist. Adi Shankara is believed to be the organiser of the Dashanami monastic order and unified the Shanmata tradition of worship. He is also known as Adi Shankaracharya, Shankara Bhagavatpada, sometimes spelled as Sankaracharya, <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">(Ādi) Śaṅkarācārya</i>, <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Śaṅkara Bhagavatpāda</i> and <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Śaṅkara Bhagavatpādācārya</i>.

<p><b>Vachaspati Mishra</b> was a 9th- or 10th-century CE Indian philosopher. He wrote so broadly that he was known as "one for whom all systems are his own", or in Sanskrit, a <i>sarva-tantra-sva-tantra</i>. Vācaspati Miśra was a prolific scholar and his writings are extensive, including bhasya (commentaries) on key texts of almost every 9th-century school of Hindu philosophy with notes on non-Hindu or <i>nāstika</i> traditions such as Buddhism and Carvaka. He also wrote one non-commentary, <i>Tattvabindu,</i> or <i>Drop of Truth</i>, which focuses on Mīmāṃsā theories of sentence meaning. Some of his works are lost to history or yet to be found.</p><p>Little is known about Vācaspati Miśra\'s life, and the earliest text that has been dated with certainty is from 840 CE, and he was at least one generation younger than Adi Śaṅkara. However, an alternate date for the same text may be 976 CE, according to some scholars, a confusion that is based on whether Hindu Śaka or Vikrama era calendar is used for the dating purposes. His scholarship is revered in the Hindu tradition, which believes that he was a Maithila Brahmin from Andhra Tharhi 
Bihar.</p>',

<p><b>Jayanta Bhatta</b> (c. 9th Century CE) was a Kashmir poet and a philosopher of Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy. In his philosophical treatise <i>Nyayamanjari</i> and drama <i>Agamadambara</i>, Jayanta mentions the king Shankaravarman (883 – 902 CE) as his contemporary. Also, his son Abhinanda in his <i>Kadambari-kathasara</i>, mentioned that the great grandfather of Jayanta was a minister of King Lalitaditya of 8th century CE. So most probably Jayanta belonged to the last quarter of 9th Century CE.</p>',

He was born in a Tamil Brāhmin family in the village of Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. His philosophical foundations for devotionalism were influential to the Bhakti movement.</p><p><i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Rāmānuja</i>\'s guru was Yādava Prakāśa, a scholar who was a part of the more ancient Advaita Vedānta monastic tradition. Sri Vaishnava tradition holds that <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Rāmānuja</i> disagreed with his guru and the non-dualistic Advaita Vedānta, and instead followed in the footsteps of Indian Alvārs tradition, the scholars Nāthamuni and Yamunāchārya. <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Rāmānuja</i> is famous as the chief proponent of Vishishtadvaita subschool of Vedānta, and his disciples were likely authors of texts such as the Shatyayaniya Upanishad. <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Rāmānuja</i> himself wrote influential texts, such as bhāsya on the <i>Brahma Sutras</i> and the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>, all in Sanskrit.</p><p>His Vishishtadvaita (qualified monism) philosophy has competed with the Dvaita (theistic dualism) philosophy of Madhvāchārya, and Advaita (monism) philosophy of Ādi Shankara, together the three most influential Vedantic philosophies of the 2nd millennium. <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Rāmānuja</i> presented the epistemic and soteriological importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in <i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Rāmānuja</i>\'s case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Ātman (soul) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman.</p>

<p><b>Gorakhnath</b> (also known as <b>Goraksanath</b>, estimated c. early 11th century) was a Hindu yogi and saint who was the influential founder of the Nath Hindu monastic movement in India. He is considered as one of the two notable disciples of Matsyendranath. His followers are found in India at the place known as Garbhagiri which is in Ahmednagar in the state of Maharashtra. These followers are called yogis, <i>Gorakhnathi</i>, <i>Darshani</i> or <i>Kanphata</i>.</p><p>The details of his biography are unknown and disputed. He was one of nine saints also known as Navnath and is widely popular in Maharashtra, India. Hagiographies describe him as more than a human teacher and someone outside the laws of time who appeared on earth in different ages. Historians state Gorakhnath lived sometime during the first half of the 2nd millennium CE, but they disagree in which century. Estimates based on archaeology and text range from Briggs\' 11th- to 12th-century to Grierson\'s estimate of the 14th-century.</p><p>Gorakhnath is considered a <i>Maha-yogi</i> (or great yogi) in the Hindu tradition. He did not emphasize a specific metaphysical theory or a particular Truth, but emphasized that the search for Truth and the spiritual life is a valuable and normal goal of man. Gorakhnath championed Yoga, spiritual discipline and an ethical life of self-determination as a means to reaching samadhi and one\'s own spiritual truths. His followers are also famous for having been part of the warrior ascetic movement since the 14th-century, to militarily resist persecution against the Islamic and British colonial rule, developing martial arts and targeted response against high officials.</p><p>Gorakhnath, his ideas and yogis have been highly popular in rural India, with monasteries and temples dedicated to him found in many states of India, particularly in the eponymous city of Gorakhpur. Among urban elites, the movement founded by Gorakhnath has been ridiculed.</p>',

<p><b>Basavanna</b> (<b>ಬಸವಣ್ಣ</b>) was a 12th-century philosopher, statesman, Kannada poet in the Niraakaara (formless identity) Shiva-focussed Bhakti movement and a social reformer during the reign of the Kalachuri-dynasty king Bijjala I in Karnataka, India.</p><p>Basavanna spread social awareness through his poetry, popularly known as <i>Vachanaas</i>. Basavanna rejected gender or social discrimination, superstitions and rituals such as the wearing of sacred thread, but introduced <i>Ishtalinga</i> necklace, with an image of the Shiva Liṅga, to every person regardless of his or her birth, to be a constant reminder of one\'s bhakti (devotion) to Shiva. As the chief minister of his kingdom, he introduced new public institutions such as the <i>Anubhava Mantapa</i> (or, the "hall of spiritual experience"), which welcomed men and women from all socio-economic backgrounds to discuss spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open.</p><p>The traditional legends and hagiographic texts state Basava to be the founder of the Lingayats. However, modern scholarship relying on historical evidence such as the Kalachuri inscriptions state that Basava was the poet philosopher who revived, refined and energized an already existing tradition. The <i>Basavarajadevara Ragale</i> (13 out of 25 sections are available) by the Kannada poet Harihara (c.1180) is the earliest available account on the life of the social reformer and is considered important because the author was a near contemporary of his protagonist. A full account of Basava\'s life and ideas are narrated in a 13th-century sacred Telugu text, the <i>Basava Purana</i> by Palkuriki Somanatha.</p><p>Basava literary works include the Vachana Sahitya in Kannada Language. He is also known as <b>Bhaktibhandari</b> (literally, the treasurer of devotion), <b>Basavanna</b> (elder brother Basava) or <b>Basaveswara</b> (Lord Basava).</p>',

<p><b>Madhvacharya</b> (<i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Madhvācārya</i>; Kannada: <span lang="kn">ಮಧ್ವಾಚಾರ್ಯ</span>; <small>Sanskrit pronunciation: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[məd̪ʱʋɑːˈtʃɑːrjə]</span>; CE 1238–1317 ), sometimes anglicised as <b>Madhva Acharya</b>, and also known as <b>Pūrna Prajña Tīrtha</b> and <b>Ānanda Tīrtha</b>, was a Hindu philosopher and the chief proponent of the <i>Dvaita</i> (dualism) school of Vedanta. Madhva called his philosophy <i>Tatvavāda</i> meaning "arguments from a realist viewpoint".</p><p>Madhvacharya was born on the west coast of Karnataka state in 13th-century India. As a teenager, he became a Sanyasi (monk) joining Brahma-sampradaya guru Achyutapreksha, of the Ekadandi order. Madhva studied the classics of Hindu philosophy, particularly the Principal Upanishads, the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> and the Brahma Sutras (<i>Prasthanatrayi</i>). He commented on these, and is credited with thirty seven works in Sanskrit. His writing style was of extreme brevity and condensed expression. His greatest work is considered to be the <i>Anuvyakhyana</i>, a philosophical supplement to his bhasya on the Brahma Sutras composed with a poetic structure. In some of his works, he proclaimed himself to be an avatar of Vayu, the son of god Vishnu.</p><p>He was a critic of Adi Shankara\'s Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja\'s Vishishtadvaita Vedanta teachings. He toured India several times, visiting places such as Bengal, Varanasi, Dwarka, Goa and Kanyakumari, engaging in philosophical debates and visiting Hindu centres of learning. Madhva established the Krishna Mutt at Udupi with a murti secured from Dwarka Gujarat in CE 1285.</p><p>Madhvācārya\'s teachings are built on the premise that there is a fundamental difference between Atman (individual soul, self) and the Brahman (ultimate reality, God Vishnu), these are two different unchanging realities, with individual soul dependent on Brahman, never identical. His school\'s theistic dualism teachings disagreed with the monist teachings of the other two most influential schools of Vedanta based on Advaita\'s nondualism and Vishishtadvaita\'s qualified nondualism. Liberation, asserted Madhva, is achievable only through the grace of God. The Dvaita school founded by Madhva influenced Vaishnavism, the Bhakti movement in medieval India, and has been one of the three influential Vedānta philosophies, along with Advaita Vedanta and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. Madhva\'s historical influence in Hinduism, state Kulandran and Kraemer, has been salutary, but not extensive.</p>',

<p><b>Nimbarka</b> is an Indian philosopher of 12th century CE, known for propagating the Vaishnava theology of Dvaitadvaita (dvaita-advaita) or “dualistic non-dualism". It is also known as \'Bhedābheda\' (bheda-abheda) philosophy.
</p><p>According to his eponymous tradition, the Nimbārka Sampradāya, Śrī Nimbārkāchārya appeared in the year 3096 BCE, when the grandson of Arjuna was on the throne.  Contrarily, scholars headed by Prof. Roma Bose theorise he lived in the 13th Century, on the presupposition that Śrī Nimbārkāchārya was the author of the work <i>Madhvamukhamardana</i>. This has been proven to be an erroneous attribution.</p><p>Bhandarkar has placed him after Ramanuja, suggesting 1162 AD as the date of his demise. S.N.Dasgupta  dated Nimbarka to around middle of 14th Century. On the other hand, S. A. A. Rizvi assigns a date of c.1130–1200 AD.</p><p>Current scholarship has pointed out that in Bhandarkar\'s own work it is clearly stated that this was an approximation based on an extremely flimsy calculation, yet most scholars chose to honour his suggested date, even until modern times. The latest scholarship has demonstrated with a high degree of clarity that Nimbarka and his immediate disciple Shrinivasa flourished well before Ramanuja, and that Shrinivasa was a contemporary, or just after Sankaracarya.</p><p>According to tradition, Nimbārka was born in Vaidūryapattanam, the present-day Mungi Village, Paithan in East Maharashtra. His parents were Aruṇa Ṛṣi and Jayantī Devī. Together, they migrated to Mathurā and settled at what is now known as Nimbagrāma (Neemgaon), situated between Barsānā and Govardhan.

<p><b>Kabir</b> (IAST: Kabīr) was a 15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint, whose writings, according to some scholars, influenced Hinduism\'s Bhakti movement. However the word "Bhakti" (with clear reference to Kirtana or chanting of names of God in devotion) has been mentioned in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita numerous times and the Bhagavad Gita predates Kabir by thousands of years. Hence it is highly doubtful that Kabir influenced the Bhakti movement in India. Kabir\'s verses are found in Sikhism\'s scripture Guru Granth Sahib. His early life was in a Muslim family, but he was strongly influenced by his teacher, the Hindu bhakti leader Ramananda.</p><p>Kabir is known for being critical of both  Hinduism and Islam, stating that the former was misguided by the Vedas, and questioning their meaningless rites of initiation such as the sacred thread and circumcision respectively. During his lifetime, he was threatened by both Hindus and Muslims for his views. When he died, both Hindus and Muslims he had inspired claimed him as theirs.(There was dispute whether to cremate or bury his corpse).
</p><p>Kabir suggested that True God is with the person who is on the path of righteousness, considered all creatures on earth as his own self, and who is passively detached from the affairs of the world.</p><p>Kabir\'s legacy survives and continues through the Kabir panth ("Path of Kabir"), a religious community that recognises him as its founder and is one of the Sant Mat sects. Its members are known as <i>Kabir panthis</i>.</p>',

<p><b> Vyāsatīrtha</b> (c. 1460–c. 1539), also called <i>Vyasaraja</i> or <i>Chandrikacharya</i>, was a Madhva scholar and poet belonging to the Dvaita order of Vedanta. As the patron saint of the Vijayanagara Empire, Vyasatirtha was at the forefront of a golden age in Dvaita which saw new developments in dialectical thought, growth of the Haridasa literature under bards like Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa and an amplified spread of Dvaita across the subcontinent. Three of his polemically themed  doxographical works <i>Nyayamruta</i>, <i>Tatparya Chandrika</i> and <i>Tarka Tandava</i> (collectively called <i>Vyasa Traya</i>) documented and critiqued an encyclopaedic range of sub-philosophies in Advaita, Visistadvaita, Mahayana Buddhism, Mimamsa and Nyaya, revealing internal contradictions and fallacies. His <i>Nyayamruta</i> caused a significant stir in the Advaita community across the country requiring a rebuttal by Madhusudhana Saraswati through his text, <i>Advaitasiddhi</i>.
</p><p>Born into a Brahmin family as <i>Yatiraja</i>, Bramhanya Tirtha, the pontiff of the matha at Abbur, assumed guardianship over him and oversaw his education. He studied the six orthodox schools of Hinduism at Kanchi and subsequently, the philosophy of Dvaita under Sripadaraja at Mulbagal, eventually succeeding him as the pontiff. He served as a spiritual adviser to Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya at Chandragiri though his most notable association was with the Tuluva king Krishna Deva Raya. With the royal patronage of the latter, Vyasatirtha undertook a massive expansion of Dvaita into the scholarly circles, through his polemical tracts as well as into the lives of the laymen through devotional songs and poems. In this regard, he penned several <i>kirtanas</i> under the nom de plume of <i>Krishna</i> including the classical Carnatic song <i>Krishna Ni Begane Baaro</i>. Polticially, Vyasatirtha was responsible for the development of irrigation systems in villages such as Bettakonda and establishment of several Vayu temples in the newly conquered regions between Bengaluru and Mysore in-order to quell any rebellion and facilitate their integration into the Empire.
</p><p>For his contribution to the Dvaita school of thought, he, along with Madhva and Jayatirtha, are considered to be the three great saints of Dvaita (<i>munitraya</i>). Scholar Surendranath Dasgupta notes, "The logical skill and depth of acute dialectical thinking shown by Vyasa-tirtha stands almost unrivalled in the whole field of Indian thought".</p>',

<p><b>Vallabhacharya</b> (1479–1531 CE), also known as <b>Vallabha</b>, was a Hindu theologian and philosopher who founded the Krishna-centered Pushti sect of Vaishnavism in the Braj region of India, and the philosophy of Shuddha advaita (Pure Nondualism).</p><p>Vallabha was born in a Telugu Brahmin family that had been living in Varanasi, who escaped to the Champaran of Chhattisgarh state while expecting Vallabha, during the turbulent times of Hindu-Muslim conflicts in the late 15th century. Vallabha studied the Vedas and the Upanishads as a child, then travelled throughout the Indian subcontinent over 20 years. He became one of the important leaders of the devotional Bhakti movement. The hagiographies written by his followers, just like those for other Bhakti leaders, claim that he won many philosophical debates against the followers of Ramanuja, Madhvacharya and others, had visions and miracles.</p><p>He is the Acharya and Guru within the Pushti sub-tradition, which he founded after his own interpretation of the Vedanta philosophy. Vallabha rejected asceticism and monastic life, suggested that through loving devotion to God Krishna, any householder could achieve salvation – an idea that became influential in western Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. He is associated with Vishnuswami, and is the prominent Acharya of Rudra Sampradaya out of the four Vaishnava Sampradayas.</p><p>He authored many texts including the Anubhashya (a commentary on Brahm Sutra), Shodash Granth or sixteen \'stotras\' (tracts) and several commentaries on the Bhagavata Purana. Vallabha\'s writings and kirtan compositions focus on baby Krishna and his childhood pranks with Yashoda (unconditional motherly love), as well as a youthful Krishna in relationship (erotic mysticism) with cowherding women as the many lilas (pastimes) of Krishna, Krishna\'s protection of the good (divine grace) and his victory over demons and evils, all with allegory and symbolism. His legacy is best preserved in the Braj region, and particularly at Nathdwara in Mewar region of India – an important Krishna pilgrimage center.</p>',

<p><b>Ravidas</b> was a North Indian mystic poet-sant of the bhakti movement during the 15th to 16th century CE. Venerated as a <i>guru</i> (teacher) in the region of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh   the devotional songs of Ravidas made a lasting impact upon the bhakti movement. He was a poet-saint, social reformer and a spiritual figure. He is considered as the founder of 21st-century Ravidassia religion, by a group who previously were associated with Sikhism.</p><p>The life details of Ravidas are uncertain and contested. Most scholars believe he was born about 1450 CE, in a family that worked with dead animals skin to produce leather products and very much known in India as untouchables. Tradition and medieval era texts state Ravidas was one of the disciples of the brahmin bhakti saint-poet Ramananda.</p><p>Ravidas\' devotional songs were included in the Sikh Scriptures, Guru Granth Sahib. The <i>Panch Vani</i> text of the Dadupanthi tradition within Hinduism also includes numerous poems of Ravidas. Ravidas taught removal of social divisions of caste and gender, and promoted unity in the pursuit of personal spiritual freedoms.</p>',

<p><b>Meera</b>, also known as <b>Meera Bai</b> or <b>Mirabai</b> (1498-1546) was a Hindu mystic poet of the Bhakti movement. She referred to the Lord, whom she saw as her husband, with different names like Satguru, Prabhu Ji, Girdhar Nagar, Krishna. She even called him the husband of her soul. Due to their mother, her in-laws disapproved of her public singing and dancing as she belonged to a Royal Family of Mewarh and was a princess. But she had too much love for her god and sacrificed everything, even her family, for god and attained Moksha through Bhakti Yoga. She is a celebrated Bhakti saint, particularly in the North Indian Hindu tradition.</p><p>Meera Bai was born into family of Merta, Rajasthan, India. She is mentioned in Bhaktamal, confirming that she was widely known and a cherished figure in the Bhakti movement culture by about 1600 CE. Most legends about Meera mention her fearless disregard for social and family conventions, her devotion to Lord 
Krishna, her treating Krishna as her husband, and she being persecuted by her in-laws for her religious devotion. She has been the subject of numerous folk tales and hagiographic legends, which are inconsistent or widely different in details.
She is royal
Thousands of devotional poems in passionate praise of Lord Krishna are attributed to Meera in the Indian tradition, but just a few hundred are believed to be authentic by scholars, and the earliest written records suggest that except for two poems, most were written down only in the 18th century. Many poems attributed to Meera were likely composed later by others who admired Meera. These poems are commonly known as <i>bhajans</i>, and are popular across India. Hindu temples, such as in Chittorgarh fort, are dedicated to Mira Bai\'s memory. Legends about Meera\'s life, of contested authenticity, have been the subject of movies, comic strips and other popular literature in modern times.</p>',

<p><b>Madhusūdana Sarasvatī</b> (c.1540–1640) was an Indian philosopher in the Advaita Vedānta tradition. He was the disciple of Viśveśvara Sarasvatī and Mādhava Sarasvatī, and is the most celebrated name in the annals of the great dvaita-advaita debate. His <i>Advaitasiddhi</i> is a somewhat classic work, and most Advaita teachers maintain that all the logical issues raised by the dvaita school of Ananda Tīrtha are sufficiently answered by Madhusūdana.

<p><b>Debendranath Tagore</b> (Bengali: <span lang="bn">দেবেন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুর</span>, <i>Debendronath Ţhakur</i>) (15 May 1817 – 19 January 1905) was a Hindu philosopher and religious reformer, active in the Brahmo Samaj ("Society of Brahman," also translated as "Society of God"), which aimed to reform the Hindu religion and way of life. He was one of the founders in 1848 of the Brahmo religion, which today is synonymous with Brahmoism.
</p><p>A Bengali, he was born in Shilaidaha. His father was the industrialist Dwarkanath Tagore.
</p><p>Debendranath was a deeply religious man. His movement, the Brahmo Samaj, was formed in 1843 by merging his Tattwabodhini Sabha with the Brahmo Sabha, ten years after the death of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, founder of the Brahmo Sabha.  The Brahmo Sabha had fallen away from its original aims and practices, as stated in its Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha.  However, Tagore aimed to revive the importance of this deed.
</p><p>Although Debendranath was deeply spiritual, he managed to continue to maintain his worldly affairs – he did not renounce his material possessions, as some Hindu traditions prescribed, but instead continued to enjoy them in a spirit of detachment. His considerable material property included estates spread over several districts of Bengal; most famously, the Santiniketan estate near Bolpur in the Birbhum district, a later acquisition, where his eldest son Dwijendranath Tagore set up his school.
</p><p>Debendranath was a master of the Upanishads and played no small role in the education and cultivation of the faculties of his sons.

<p><b>Dayanand Saraswati</b> <span><span><span> </span>pronunciation</span> </span> (12 February 1824 – 30 October 1883) was an Indian religious leader and founder of the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movement of the Vedic dharma. He was also a renowned scholar of the Vedic lore and Sanskrit language. He was the first to give the call for <i>Swaraj</i> as "India for Indians" in 1876, a call later taken up by Lokmanya Tilak. Denouncing the idolatry and ritualistic worship prevalent in Hinduism at the time, he worked towards reviving Vedic ideologies. Subsequently, the philosopher and President of India, S. Radhakrishnan called him one of the "makers of Modern India", as did Sri Aurobindo.</p><p>Those who were influenced by and followed Dayananda included Madam Cama, Pandit Lekh Ram, Swami Shraddhanand, Pandit Guru Dutt Vidyarthi, Shyamji Krishna Varma (who established India House in England for Freedom fighters,) Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Lala Hardayal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Ram Prasad Bismil, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Mahatma Hansraj, Lala Lajpat Rai, and others. One of his most influential works is the book <i>Satyarth Prakash</i>, which contributed to the Indian independence movement.
</p><p>He was a sanyasi (ascetic) from boyhood, and a scholar. He believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas. Maharshi Dayananda advocated the doctrine of Karma and Reincarnation. He emphasized the Vedic ideals of brahmacharya, including celibacy and devotion to God.
</p><p>Among Maharshi Dayananda\'s contributions are his promoting of the equal rights for women, such as the right to education and reading of Indian scriptures, and his commentary on the Vedas from Vedic Sanskrit in Sanskrit as well as in Hindi.

<p><b>Sai Baba of Shirdi</b>, also known as <b>Shirdi Sai Baba</b>, was an Indian spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees as a saint, a fakir, a <i>satguru</i> and an incarnation (avatar) of Lord Shiva and Dattatreya. He is revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees during, as well as after his lifetime. 
Saibaba is now revered as incarnation of Sri Dattatreya, and considered as Saguna Brahma. He is attributed to be the creator, sustainer and destroyer of this universe by his devotees. He is decorated with jewels and all forms of Hindu vedic deities as he is supreme God.
</p><p>According to accounts from his life, he preached the importance of <i>realization of the self</i>, and criticized <i>love towards perishable things</i>. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true <i>Satguru</i>, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.</p><p>Sai Baba also condemned distinction based on religion or caste. It remains unclear if he was a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name <i>Dwarakamayi</i> to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, <i>Allah Malik</i> (<i>God is King</i>) and <i>Sabka Malik Ek</i> (<i>Everyone\'s Master is One</i>), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said <i>Look to me, and I shall look to you</i>.</p>',

<p><b>Swami Vivekananda</b>  (<small>Bengali: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʃami bibekanɔndo]</span><small class="nowrap"> (<span><span><span> </span>listen</span></span>)</small>; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born <b>Narendranath Datta</b> (<small>Bengali: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]</span>), was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, "Sisters and brothers of America ...," in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World\'s Religions in Chicago in 1893.
</p><p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna\'s death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World\'s Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day.

<p><b>Rabindranath Tagore</b> FRAS (7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941), sobriquet <b>Gurudev</b>,  was a Bengali polymath from the Indian subcontinent, who was a poet, musician and artist. He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of <i>Gitanjali</i> and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore\'s poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as "the Bard of Bengal".</p><p>A Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym <i>Bhānusiṃha</i> ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.</p><p>Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. <i>Gitanjali</i> (<i>Song Offerings</i>), <i>Gora</i> (<i>Fair-Faced</i>) and <i>Ghare-Baire</i> (<i>The Home and the World</i>) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India\'s <i>Jana Gana Mana</i> and Bangladesh\'s <i>Amar Shonar Bangla</i>. The Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work.</p>',

<p><b>Sir Brajendra Nath Seal</b> (Bengali: <span lang="bn">ব্রজেন্দ্রনাথ শীল</span>; September 3, 1864 – 1938) was a renowned Bengali Indian humanist philosopher. He was one of the greatest original thinkers of the Brahmo Samaj and did work in comparative religion and on the philosophy of science. He systematised the humanism of the Brahmo philosophical thought. In his work, he underscored the tectonic shift in Brahmo theology in the late eighteenth century from liberal theism to secular humanism. Like his better known ideological precursor Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Seal was an educator, a firm believer in the cause of rationalism and scientific enquiry, a polymath in his own right and yet at the same time a preacher of humanism as a religious doctrine (as opposed to organised religion).

<p><b>Sri Aurobindo</b> (born <b>Aurobindo Ghose</b>; 15 August 1872 – 5 December 1950) was an Indian philosopher, yogi, guru, poet, and nationalist. He joined the Indian movement for independence from British rule, for a while was one of its influential leaders and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing his visions on human progress and spiritual evolution.
</p><p>Aurobindo studied for the Indian Civil Service at King\'s College, Cambridge, England. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and became increasingly involved in nationalist politics and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bomb outrages linked to his organisation, but in a highly public trial where he faced charges of treason, Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail, he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work.
</p><p>During his stay in Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo developed a method of spiritual practice he called Integral Yoga. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life divine. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated man but transformed his nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (referred to as "The Mother"), he founded the Sri Aurobindo Ashram.
</p><p>His main literary works are <i>The Life Divine</i>, which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga; <i>Synthesis of Yoga</i>, which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga; and <i>Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol</i>, an epic poem. His works also include philosophy, poetry, translations and commentaries on the <i>Vedas</i>, <i>Upanishads</i> and the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1943 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.</p>',

<p><b>Sir Muhammad Iqbal</b> (Urdu: <span lang="ur" dir="rtl"><span dir="rtl" title="Nastaliq">محمد اِقبال</span>‬</span>‎) (November 9, 1877 – April 21, 1938),  widely known as <b>Allama Iqbal</b>, was a poet, philosopher and politician, as well as an academic, barrister and scholar in British India who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement. He is called the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan." He is considered one of the most important figures in Urdu literature, with literary work in both Urdu and Persian.</p><p>Iqbal is admired as a prominent poet by Indians, Pakistanis, Iranians and other international scholars of literature. Though Iqbal is best known as an eminent poet, he is also a highly acclaimed "Muslim philosophical thinker of modern times". His first poetry book, <i>The Secrets of the Self</i>, appeared in the Persian language in 1915, and other books of poetry include <i>The Secrets of Selflessness</i>, <i>Message from the East</i> and <i>Persian Psalms</i>. Amongst these, his best known Urdu works are <i>The Call of the Marching Bell</i>, <i>Gabriel\'s Wing</i>, <i>The Rod of Moses</i> and a part of <i>Gift from Hijaz</i>. Along with his Urdu and Persian poetry, his Urdu and English lectures and letters have been very influential in cultural, social, religious and political disputes.</p><p>In the 1923 New Years Honours he was made a Knight Bachelor by King George V, While studying law and philosophy in England, Iqbal became a member of the London branch of the All-India Muslim League. Later, during the League\'s December 1930 session, he delivered his most famous presidential speech known as the Allahabad Address in which he pushed for the creation of a Muslim state in northwest India.</p><p>In much of South Asia and the Urdu-speaking world, Iqbal is regarded as the <i>Shair-e-Mashriq</i> (Urdu: <span lang="ur" dir="rtl"><span dir="rtl" title="Nastaliq">شاعر مشرق</span>‬</span>‎, "Poet of the East"). He is also called <i>Mufakkir-e-Pakistan</i> (Urdu: <span lang="ur" dir="rtl"><span dir="rtl" title="Nastaliq">مفکر پاکستان</span>‬</span>‎, "The Thinker of Pakistan"), <i>Musawar-e-Pakistan</i> (Urdu: <span lang="ur" dir="rtl"><span dir="rtl" title="Nastaliq">مصور پاکستان</span>‬</span>‎, "Artist of Pakistan") and <i>Hakeem-ul-Ummat</i> (Urdu: <span lang="ur" dir="rtl"><span dir="rtl" title="Nastaliq">حکیم الامت</span>‬</span>‎, "The Sage of the Ummah"). The Pakistan government officially named him  "National Poet of Pakistan". His birthday <i>Yōm-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl</i> (Urdu: <span lang="ur" dir="rtl"><span dir="rtl" title="Nastaliq">یوم ولادت محمد اقبال</span>‬</span>‎), or Iqbal Day, is a public holiday in Pakistan.</p><p>Iqbal\'s house is still located in Sialkot and is recognized as Iqbal\'s Manzil and is open for visitors. His other house where he lived most of his life and died is in Lahore, named as Javed Manzil.( "Javed Manzil". ualberta.ca. Retrieved 24 July 2014.) The museum is located on Allama Iqbal Road near Lahore Railway Station, Punjab, Pakistan. It was protected under the Punjab Antiquities Act of 1975, and declared a Pakistani national monument in 1977.</p>',

<p><b>Ramana Maharshi</b> <span></span> (30 December 1879 – 14 April 1950) was a Hindu sage and jivanmukta. He was born as Venkataraman Iyer, but is most commonly known by the name Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.</p><p>He was born in what is now Tiruchuli, Tamil Nadu, India. In 1895, an attraction to the sacred hill Arunachala and the 63 Nayanars was aroused in him, and in 1896, at the age of 16, he had a "death-experience" where he became aware of a "current" or "force" (<i>avesam</i>) which he recognised as his true "I" or "self", and which he later identified with "the personal God, or Iswara," that is, Shiva. This resulted in a state that he later described as "the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani". Six weeks later he left his uncle\'s home in Madurai, and journeyed to the holy mountain Arunachala, in Tiruvannamalai, where he took on the role of a sannyasin (though not formally initiated), and remained for the rest of his life.
</p><p>He soon attracted devotees who regarded him as an avatar and came to him for darshan ("the sight of God"), and in later years an ashram grew up around him, where visitors received upadesa ("spiritual instruction") by sitting silently in his company asking questions. Since the 1930s his teachings have been popularized in the West, resulting in his worldwide recognition as an enlightened being.</p><p>Ramana Maharshi approved a number of paths and practices, but recommended self-enquiry as the principal means to remove ignorance and abide in Self-awareness, together with bhakti (devotion) or surrender to the Self.</p>',

<p><b>Swami Nigamananda Paramahansa</b> (born <b>Nalinikanta Chattopadhyay</b>; 18 August 1880 – 29 November 1935) was an Indian Hindu yogi, guru and mystic well known in Eastern India. He was associated with the shakti cult and viewed as a perfect spiritual master of tantra, gyan, yoga and prema or bhakti. His followers idealized him as their worshipped and beloved thakura.
</p><p>Nigamananda was born into a Bengali Brahmin family in the hamlet of Kutabpur in Nadia district (at present Meherpur district Bangladesh). He was a sannyasi from Shankar\'s cult. After his ordination as a sannyasi, he came to be known as <i>Paribrajakacharya Paramahansa Srimat Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Deva</i>.</p><p>Nigamananda  achieved siddhi (perfection) in four different sadhanas (spiritual disciplines): tantra, gyan, yoga and prema. Based on these experiences, he wrote five Bengali language books: <i>Brahamcharya Sadhana</i> (ब्रह्मचर्य साधन), <i>Yogi Guru</i> (योगिगुरु), <i>Gyani Guru</i> (ज्ञानीगुरु), <i>Tantrika Guru</i> (तांत्रिकगुरु), and <i>Premik Guru</i> (प्रेमिकगुरु). Nigamananda reportedly experienced the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi.</p><p>After retiring from Saraswata Matha, Nigamananda spent the last fourteen years of his life in Puri. Durga Charan Mohanty, a school student, met him at Nilachala Kutir in 1930 and recognized him as sadguru. Mohanty became Nigamananda\'s disciple and wrote books for Nigamananda\'s establishment Nilachala Saraswata Sangha and translated Nigamananda\'s Bengali books into Odia. Under Mohanty\'s encouragement, more than 100 ashrams operate in Odisha. Mohanty continued to spread the message of Nigamananda until his death on 7 December 1985.</p>',

<p><b>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar</b> (<span><span><span> </span>pronunciation</span> </span>),  (28 May 1883 – 26 February 1966) was an Indian politician, lawyer and writer, known for his activism for Indian independence. Savarkar coined the term <i>Hindutva</i> (Hinduness) to create a collective "Hindu" identity as an essence of Bharat (India). His political philosophy had the elements of utilitarianism, rationalism and positivism, humanism and universalism, and realism. Savarkar was also an atheist who disapproved of orthodox beliefs in all religions.
</p><p>Savarkar\'s revolutionary activities began while studying in India and England, where he was associated with the India House and founded student societies including Abhinav Bharat Society and the Free India Society, as well as publications espousing the cause of complete Indian independence by revolutionary means. Savarkar published <i>The Indian War of Independence</i> about the Indian rebellion of 1857 that was banned by British authorities. He was arrested in 1910 for his connections with the revolutionary group India House. Following a failed attempt to escape while being transported from Marseilles, Savarkar was sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment totaling fifty years and was moved to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, but released in 1921 after several mercy petitions to the Britishers. After release, he would bribe revolutionary Chandra Shekhar Azad to stop fighting the British Raj.
</p><p>While in jail, Savarkar wrote the work describing <i>Hindutva</i>, espousing what it means to be a Hindu, and Hindu pride, in which he defined as all the people descended of Hindu culture as being part of Hindutva, including Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. In 1921, under restrictions after signing a plea for clemency, he was released on the condition that he renounce revolutionary activities. Traveling widely, Savarkar became a forceful orator and writer, advocating Hindu political and social unity. Serving as the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar endorsed the idea of India as a <i>Hindu Rashtra</i> and opposed the <i>Quit India</i> struggle in 1942, calling it a "Quit India but keep your army" movement. He became a fierce critic of the Indian National Congress and its acceptance of India\'s partition. He was accused of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi but acquitted by the court. 
</p><p>The airport at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar\'s capital, has been named Veer Savarkar International Airport. The commemorative blue plaque on India House fixed by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England reads "Vinayak Damodar Savarkar 1883-1966 Indian patriot and philosopher lived here".</p>',

<p><b>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan</b> <span><span><span> </span>listen</span> </span> (5 September 1888 – 17 April 1975) was an Indian philosopher and statesman who was the first Vice President of India (1952–1962) and the second President of India from 1962 to 1967.</p><p>One of India\'s most distinguished twentieth-century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy, his academic appointments included professor of Philosophy at the University of Mysore (1918-1921), the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta (1921–1932) and Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at University of Oxford (1936–1952).
</p><p>His philosophy was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, reinterpreting this tradition for a contemporary understanding. He defended Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism", contributing to the formation of contemporary Hindu identity. He has been influential in shaping the understanding of Hinduism, in both India and the west, and earned a reputation as a bridge-builder between India and the West.</p><p>Radhakrishnan was awarded several high awards during his life, including a knighthood in 1931, the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award in India, in 1954, and honorary membership of the British Royal Order of Merit in 1963. He was also one of the founders of Helpage India, a non profit organisation for elderly underprivileged in India. Radhakrishnan believed that "teachers should be the best minds in the country". Since 1962, his birthday is being celebrated in India as Teachers\' Day on 5 September.</p>',

<p><b>Nolini Kanta Gupta</b> (13 January 1889 – 7 February 1983) was a revolutionary, linguist, scholar, critic, poet, philosopher and yogi, and the most senior of Sri Aurobindo\'s disciples. He was born in Faridpur, East Bengal, to a cultured and prosperous Vaidya-Brahmin family. While in his teens he came under the influence of Sri Aurobindo, then a well known revolutionary fighting for independence against the British. When in his fourth year at Presidency College, Calcutta, he left a promising academic career and rejected a lucrative government job to join a small revolutionary group under Sri Aurobindo. In May 1908 he was among those arrested for conspiracy in the Alipore bomb case. Acquitted a year later, after having spent a year in jail, he worked as a sub-editor for the <i>Dharma</i> and the <i>Karmayogin</i>, two of Sri Aurobindo\'s Nationalist newspapers, in 1909 and 1910.
</p><p>He was taught Greek, Latin, French and Italian by Sri Aurobindo himself and was among the four disciples who were with Aurobindo in 1910 at Pondicherry. When the Sri Aurobindo Ashram was founded in 1926, he settled permanently in Pondicherry serving the Mother and Sri Aurobindo as secretary of the ashram and later as one of its trustees. A prolific writer on a wide range of topics, he has about 60 books to his credit of which about 16 are in English and 44 in Bengali, as well as many articles and poems in English, Bengali and French.
</p><p>Nolini Kanta Gupta died at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram on 7 February 1984.

<p><b>Jiddu Krishnamurti</b> (<span></span>; 12 May 1895 – 17 February 1986) was an Indian philosopher, speaker and writer. In his early life he was groomed to be the new World Teacher but later rejected this mantle and withdrew from the Theosophy organization behind it. His subject matter included psychological revolution, the nature of mind, meditation, inquiry, human relationships, and bringing about radical change in society. He constantly stressed the need for a revolution in the psyche of every human being and emphasised that such revolution cannot be brought about by any external entity, be it religious, political, or social.
</p><p>Krishnamurti was born in India. In early adolescence he had a chance encounter with prominent occultist and theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater in the grounds of the Theosophical Society headquarters at Adyar in Madras. He was subsequently raised under the tutelage of Annie Besant and Leadbeater, leaders of the Society at the time, who believed him to be a \'vehicle\' for an expected World Teacher. As a young man, he disavowed this idea and dissolved the Order of the Star in the East, an organisation that had been established to support it.
</p><p>Krishnamurti said he had no allegiance to any nationality, caste, religion, or philosophy, and spent the rest of his life travelling the world, speaking to large and small groups and individuals. He wrote many books, among them <i>The First and Last Freedom</i>, <i>The Only Revolution</i>, and <i>Krishnamurti\'s Notebook</i>. Many of his talks and discussions have been published. His last public talk was in Madras, India, in January 1986, a month before his death at his home in Ojai, California. His supporters — working through non-profit foundations in India, Great Britain and the United States — oversee several independent schools based on his views on education. They continue to transcribe and distribute his thousands of talks, group and individual discussions, and writings by use of a variety of media formats and languages.
</p><p>Krishnamurti was unrelated to his contemporary U. G. Krishnamurti (1918-2007), although the two men had a number of meetings.</p>',

<p><b>Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</b> (<i lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration">Abhaya Caraṇāravinda Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Prabhupāda</i>; Bengali: <span lang="bn">অভয়চরণারবিন্দ ভক্তিবেদান্ত স্বামী প্রভুপাদ</span>; 4 September 1896 – 14 November 1977) was an Indian Hindu spiritual teacher and the founder preceptor (Acharya) of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the "Hare Krishna Movement".  Members of the ISKCON movement view Prabhupada as a representant and messenger of Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p><p>Born <b>Abhay Charan De</b> in Calcutta, he was educated at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta. Before adopting the life of a pious renunciant (vanaprastha) in 1950, he was married with children and owned a small pharmaceutical business. In 1959 he took a vow of renunciation (sannyasa) and started writing commentaries on Vaishnava scriptures. In his later years, as a travelling Vaishnava monk, he became an influential communicator of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology to India and specifically to the West through his leadership of ISKCON, founded in 1966. As the founder of ISKCON, he "emerged as a major figure of the Western counterculture, initiating thousands of young Americans." He received criticism from anti-cult groups, as well as a favourable welcome from religious scholars such as J. Stillson Judah, Harvey Cox, Larry Shinn and Thomas Hopkins, who praised Bhaktivedanta Swami\'s translations and defended the group against distorted media images and misinterpretations. In respect to his achievements, religious leaders from other Gaudiya Vaishnava movements have also given him credit.</p><p>He has been described as a charismatic leader, in the sense used by sociologist Max Weber, as he was successful in acquiring followers in the United States, Europe, India and elsewhere. His mission was to propagate, throughout the world, Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a school of Vaishnavite Hinduism that had been taught to him by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. After his death in 1977, ISKCON, the society he founded based on a type of Hindu Krishnaism using the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> as a central scripture, continued to grow. In February 2014, ISKCON\'s news agency reported reaching a milestone of distributing over half a billion of his books since 1965.  His translation and commentaries of the <i>Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is</i> is considered by adherents to the ISKCON movement and many Vedic scholars as one of the finest literary works of Vaishnavism translated into the English Language.</p>',

<p><b>Uppaluri Gopala Krishnamurti</b> (9 July 1918 – 22 March 2007), known as <b>U. G. Krishnamurti</b>, was an Indian speaker who questioned the state of enlightenment. Although many considered him an "enlightened" person, Krishnamurti often referred to his state of being as the "natural state". He claimed that the demand for enlightenment was the only thing standing in the way of enlightenment itself, if enlightenment existed at all.
</p><p>He rejected the very basis of thought and in doing so negated all systems of thought and knowledge. Hence he explained his assertions were experiential and not speculative – "Tell them that there is <i>nothing</i> to understand."

<p><b>Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar</b> (21 May 1921 – 21 October 1990), also known by his spiritual name, <b>Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti</b> (Ánanda Múrti="Bliss Embodiment"), and known as <b>Bábá</b> ("Father") to his disciples, was an Spiritual Guru, Indian philosopher, yogi, author, social revolutionary, poet, composer, and linguist. Sarkar was the founder of <i>Ananda Marga</i> (<i>the Path of Bliss</i>) in 1955, a spiritual and social organisation that offers instruction in meditation and yoga. Gyani Zail Singh, seventh President of India, has said about Sarkar: "Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar was one of the greatest modern philosophers of India."</p><p>Sarkar\'s system of spiritual practice has been described as a practical synthesis of Vedic and Tantric philosophies. He denounced materialism and capitalism, and described the universe as a result of macropsychic conation – the entire universe exists within the cosmic mind, which itself is the first expression of consciousness coming under the bondage of its own nature.
</p><p>Sarkar was a prolific author and produced an extensive body of works that includes theories aimed at increasing human welfare such as the Law of Social Cycle, the Progressive Utilization Theory, the Theory of Microvitum, as well as the philosophy of Neohumanism.

</p>
<p><b>Rajneesh</b> (born <b>Chandra Mohan Jain</b>, 11 December 1931 – 19 January 1990), also known as <b>Acharya Rajneesh</b>, <b>Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</b>, and latterly as <b>Osho</b> (<span></span>), was an Indian godman and leader of the Rajneesh movement. During his lifetime he was viewed as a controversial new religious movement leader and mystic. In the 1960s he traveled throughout India as a public speaker and was a vocal critic of socialism, arguing that India was not ready for socialism and that socialism, communism and anarchism could evolve only when capitalism had reached its maturity. Osho also criticised Mahatma Gandhi, and Hindu religious orthodoxy. Rajneesh emphasized the importance of meditation, mindfulness, love, celebration, courage, creativity and humour—qualities that he viewed as being suppressed by adherence to static belief systems, religious tradition and socialisation. In advocating a more open attitude to human sexuality he caused controversy in India during the late 1960s and became known as "the sex guru".</p><p>In 1970, Rajneesh spent time in Mumbai initiating followers known as "neo-sannyasins". During this period he expanded his spiritual teachings and commented extensively in discourses on the writings of religious traditions, mystics, and philosophers from around the world. In 1974, Rajneesh relocated to Pune, where an ashram was established and a variety of therapies, incorporating methods first developed by the Human Potential Movement, were offered to a growing Western following. By the late 1970s, the tension between the ruling Janata Party government of Morarji Desai and the movement led to a curbing of the ashram\'s development and a back taxes claim estimated at $5 million.</p><p>In 1981, the Rajneesh movement\'s efforts refocused on activities in the United States and Rajneesh relocated to a facility known as Rajneeshpuram in Wasco County, Oregon. Almost immediately the movement ran into conflict with county residents and the state government, and a succession of legal battles concerning the ashram\'s construction and continued development curtailed its success. In 1985, in the wake of a series of serious crimes by his followers, including a mass food poisoning attack with <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria and an aborted assassination plot to murder U.S. Attorney Charles H. Turner, Rajneesh alleged that his personal secretary Ma Anand Sheela and her close supporters had been responsible. He was later deported from the United States in accordance with an Alford plea bargain.</p><p>After his deportation, 21 countries denied him entry. He ultimately returned to India and a revived Pune ashram, where he died in 1990. Rajneesh\'s ashram, now known as OSHO International Meditation Resort, and all associated intellectual property, is managed by the Zurich registered Osho International Foundation (formerly Rajneesh International Foundation). Rajneesh\'s teachings have had a notable impact on Western New Age thought, and their popularity has increased markedly since his death.</p>

</p><p>Kūkai is famous as a calligrapher and engineer. Among the many achievements attributed to him is the invention of the <i>kana,</i> the syllabary with which, in combination with Chinese characters (<i>kanji</i>), the Japanese language is written to this day. Also according to tradition, the <i>Iroha</i>, which uses every phonetic <i>kana</i> syllable just once and is one of the most famous poems in Japanese, is attributed to him but again, this is a popular belief and nowhere attested to. His religious writings, some fifty works, expound the Esoteric Shingon doctrine. The major ones have been translated into English by Yoshito Hakeda (see references below).

After discovering the writings of the Chinese Buddhist Shandao, he undertook the teaching of rebirth in the pure land of Amitābha through nianfo or "recitation of the Buddha\'s name".
</p><p>Hōnen gathered a wide array of followers and critics. Emperor Tsuchimikado exiled Hōnen and his followers in 1207 after an incident regarding two of his disciples in addition to persuasion by influential Buddhist communities. Hōnen was eventually pardoned and allowed to return to Kyoto, where he stayed for a short time before his death.

</p><p>Originally ordained as a monk in the Tendai School in Kyoto, he was ultimately dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to China to seek out what he believed to be a more authentic Buddhism. He remained there for five years, finally training under Tiantong Rujing, an eminent teacher of the Chinese Caodong lineage. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) through literary works such as <i>Fukan zazengi</i> and <i>Bendōwa</i>.
</p><p>He eventually broke relations completely with the powerful Tendai School, and, after several years of likely friction between himself and the establishment, left Kyoto for the mountainous countryside where he founded the monastery Eihei-ji, which remains the head temple of the Sōtō school today.
</p><p>Dōgen is known for his extensive writing including his most famous work, the collection of 95 essays called the <i>Shōbōgenzō</i>, but also <i>Eihei Kōroku</i>, a collection of his talks, poetry, and commentaries, and <i>Eihei Shingi</i>, the first Zen monastic code written in Japan, among others.

            'description' => '<p><b>Nichiren</b> (日蓮; born as <i>Zennichimaro</i> (善日麿), Dharma name: <i>Rencho</i> - 16 February 1222 – 13 October 1282) was a Japanese Buddhist priest who lived during the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and founded Nichiren Buddhism, a branch school of Mahayana Buddhism.</p><p>Nichiren was highly controversial in his day  and was known for preaching that the <i>Lotus Sutra</i> alone contains the highest truth of Buddhist teachings and represents the effective teaching for the Third Age of Buddhism. He declared that social and political peace are dependent on the quality of the belief system that is upheld in a nation. He advocated the repeated recitation of the Sutra\'s title, <i>Nam(u)-myoho-renge-kyo</i>.  In addition, he held that the historical Shakyamuni Buddha was the manifestation of a Buddha-nature that is equally accessible to all.  He insisted that those who claim to be believers of the Sutra must propagate it even in the face of persecution.</p><p>Nichiren was a prolific writer and his biography, temperament, and the evolution of his thinking has been primarily gleaned from his own writings. He launched his teachings in 1253, advocating an exclusive return to the Lotus Sutra as based on its original Tendai interpretations. His 1260 treatise <i>Risshō Ankoku Ron</i> (立正安国論<span></span>) (<i>On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Security of the Land</i>) argued that a nation that embraces the Lotus Sutra will experience peace and prosperity whereas rulers who support inferior religious teachings invite disorder and disaster into their realms. In a 1264 essay he stated that the title of the Lotus Sutra, <i>"Nam(u)-myoho-renge-kyo,"</i> encompasses all Buddhist teachings and its recitation leads to enlightenment. As a result of his adamant stance he experienced severe persecution imposed by the Kamakura Shogunate and consequently began to see himself as "bodily reading the Lotus Sutra (<i>Jpn. Hokke shikidoku</i>)." In some of his writings during a second exile (1271-1274) he began to identify himself with the key Lotus Sutra characters Sadāparibhūta and Visistacaritra and saw himself in the role of leading a vast outpouring of Bodhisattvas of the Earth.</p><p>In 1274, after his two predictions of foreign invasion and political strife were seemingly actualized by the first attempted Mongol invasion of Japan along with  an unsuccessful coup within the Hōjō clan, Nichiren was pardoned by the Shogunate authorities and his advice was sought but not heeded. The <i>Risshō Ankoku Ron</i> in which he first predicted foreign invasion and civil disorder  is now considered by Japanese historians to be a literary classic illustrating the apprehensions of that period. In 1358 he was bestowed the title <i>Nichiren Dai-Bosatsu</i> (日蓮大菩薩<span></span>) (<i>Great Bodhisattva Nichiren</i>)  by Emperor Go-Kōgon and in 1922 the title <i>Risshō Daishi</i> (立正大師<span></span>) (<i>Great Teacher of Rectification</i>) was conferred posthumously by imperial edict.</p><p>Nichiren remains a controversial figure among modern scholars who cast him as either a fervent nationalist or a social reformer with a transnational religious vision. Critical scholars have used words such as intolerant, nationalistic, militaristic, and self-righteous to portray him.  On the other hand, Nichiren has been presented as a revolutionary,  a classic reformer, and as a prophet. His prophecy has been compared to that of the Old Testament prophets, Martin Luther,  Muhammad, and Jesus with all sharing similar rebellious and revolutionary drives to reform degeneration in their respective societies.
</p><p>Today, Nichiren Buddhism includes traditional temple schools such as the confederation of Nichiren-shū  and Nichiren Shōshū temples, as well as modern lay movements such Kenshōkai, Shōshinkai, Risshō Kōsei Kai, Honmon Butsuryū-shū, Kempon Hokke, and Soka Gakkai.  Each group has varying views of Nichiren\'s teachings  with interpretations of Nichiren\'s identity ranging from the reincarnation of bodhisattva Visistacaritra to the primordial or "true" (本仏: <i>Honbutsu</i>) Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law.</p>

His father, Kan\'ami, introduced him to Noh theater performance at a young age, and found that he was a skilled actor. Kan\'ami was also skilled in acting and formed a family theater ensemble. As it grew in popularity, Zeami had the opportunity to perform in front of the Shōgun, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. The Shōgun was impressed by the young actor and began to compose a friendship with him. Zeami was introduced to Yoshimitsu\'s court and was provided with an education in classical literature and philosophy while continuing to act. In 1374, Zeami received patronage and made acting his career. After the death of his father in 1385, he led the family troupe, a role in which he found greater success.
</p><p>Zeami mixed a variety of Classical and Modern themes in his writing, and made use of Japanese and Chinese traditions. He incorporated numerous themes of Zen Buddhism into his works and later commentators have debated the extent of his personal interest in Zen. The exact number of plays that he wrote is unknown, but is likely to be between 30 and 50. He wrote many treatises about Noh, discussing the philosophy of performance. These treatises are the oldest known works on the philosophy of drama in Japanese literature, but did not see popular circulation until the 20th-century.
</p><p>After the death of Yoshimitsu, his successor Ashikaga Yoshimochi was less favorable to Zeami\'s drama. Zeami successfully sought out patronage from wealthy merchants and continued his career under their support. He became well-known and well-respected in Japanese society. Ashikaga Yoshinori became hostile toward Zeami after becoming Shōgun in 1429. Yoshinori held Zeami\'s nephew Onnami in high regard, and disagreed with Zeami\'s refusal to declare Onnami his successor as leader of his troupe. Possibly due to this disagreement, though a variety of competing theories have been advanced, Yoshinori sent Zeami into exile to Sado Island. After Yoshinori\'s death in 1441, Zeami returned to mainland Japan, where he died in 1443.

He is considered to be one of the most influential Confucian scholars of seventeenth century Japan, and the Tokugawa period (1600–1868) generally, his teachings flourishing especially in Kyoto and the Kansai area through the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate.
</p><p>Jinsai\'s school, known as the Kogigaku, criticized the teachings of Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200) and instead advocated a philosophical vision based on an understanding of the meanings of key terms in the <i>Analects</i> and the <i>Mencius</i>.  His school has been considered part of a larger movement, Kogaku ("ancient learning\'), including earlier scholars such as Yamaga Sokō 山鹿素行 (1622–1685), and later thinkers such as Ogyū Sorai 荻生徂徠 (1666–1728). However, Jinsai never mentions Sokō or his ideas, and Jinsai\'s own statements of philosophical meaning were strongly and systematically criticized by Sorai. Rather than as a thinker aligned with the so-called Kogaku movement, Jinsai\'s ideas are best understood on their own terms. Jinsai is widely known for his outspoken affirmation of the validity of human emotions, and his articulation of a metaphysics highlighting the pervasiveness and infinite creative potential of a "unitary generative force" (Jpn: <i>ichigenki</i>). Indicative of his renown in the larger world of East Asian philosophy, Jinsai\'s writings have frequently been compared to those of the Qing dynasty scholar Dai Zhen 戴震 (1724–1777), whose key work,  <i>Mengzi ziyi shuzheng</i> (<i>The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the</i> Mencius) is very similar in theme and method to Jinsai\'s opus, the <i>Gomō jigi</i> (<i>The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the</i> Analects <i>and</i> Mencius).

</p><p>Kaibara was born into a family of advisors to the <i>daimyō</i> of Fukuoka Domain in Chikuzen Province (modern-day Fukuoka Prefecture).  He accompanied his father to Edo in 1648, and was sent in 1649 to Nagasaki to  study Western science.  At his father\'s urging, he continued his studies in Nagasaki as a rōnin from 1650 through 1656.  He then re-entered service to Kuroda, which led to his continuing studies in Kyoto.  After his father\'s death in 1665, he returned to Fukuoka.</p><p>Kaibara\'s two most significant contributions to Japanese culture were the study of nature based on a blend of Western natural science and Neo-Confucianism, and the translation of the complex writings of Neo-Confucianism into vernacular Japanese.
</p>

<p>Kaibara\'s science was confined to Botany and Materia medica and focused on the "natural law".  Kaibara became as famous in Japan as people such as Charles Darwin when it came to science. He advanced the study of botany in Japan when he wrote <i>Yamato honzō,</i>(Medicinal herbs of Japan) which was a seminal study of Japanese plants. The 19th-century German Japanologist Philipp Franz von Siebold called him the "Aristotle of Japan".</p><p>Kaibara was known for his manuals of behavior, such as changing his Confucian ethical system based on the teachings of Zhu Xi (also known as Chu Hsi) into an easy "self-help" manuals. As an educator and philosopher, it appears that Kaibara\'s main goal in life was to further the process of weaving Neo-Confucianism into Japanese culture.  In this context, he is best known for such books as <i>Precepts for Children</i> and <i>Greater Learning for Women</i> (<i>Onna daigaku</i>); but modern scholarship argues that it was actually prepared by other hands.  Although the genesis of the work remains unchallenged, the oldest extant copy (1733) ends with the lines "as related by our teacher Ekiken Kaibara" and the publisher\'s colophon states that the text was written from lectures of our teacher Kaibara."</p>',

He responded to contemporary economic and political failings in Japan, as well as the culture of mercantilism and the dominance of old institutions that had become weak with extravagance.  Sorai rejected the moralism of Song Confucianism and instead looked to the ancient works.  He argued that allowing emotions to be expressed was important and nurtured Chinese literature in Japan for this reason.  Sorai attracted a large following with his teachings and created the Sorai school, which would become an influential force in further Confucian scholarship in Japan.

He was educated at the Kaitokudō academy founded by members of the mercantile class of Osaka, but was ostracised shortly after the age of 15. Tominaga belonged to a Japanese rationalist school of thought and advocated a Japanese variation of atheism, <i>mukishinron</i> (no gods or demons). He was also a merchant in Osaka. Only a few of his works survive; his <i>Setsuhei</i> ("Discussions on Error") has been lost and may have been the reason for his separation from the Kaitokudō, and around nine other works\' titles are known. The surviving works are his <i>Okina no Fumi</i> ("The Writings of an Old Man"), <i>Shutsujō Kōgo</i> ("Words after Enlightenment"; on textual criticism of Buddhist sutras), and three other works on ancient musical scales, ancient measurements, and poetry.
</p><p>He took a deep critical stance against normative systems of thought, partially based on the Kaitokudō\'s emphasis on objectivity, but was clearly heterodox in eschewing the dominant philosophies of the institution. He was critical of Buddhism, Confucianism and Shintoism. Whereas each of these traditions drew on history as a source of authority, Tominaga saw appeals to history as a pseudo-justification for innovations that try to outdo other sects vying for power. For example, he cited the various Confucian Masters who saw human nature as partially good, neither good nor bad, all good, and inherently bad; analysing later interpreters who tried to incorporate and reconcile all Masters. He criticised Shintoism as obscurantist, especially in its habit of secret instruction. As he always said, "hiding is the beginning of lying and stealing".</p><p>In his study of Buddhist scriptures, he asserted that Hinayana school of scriptures preceded Mahayana scriptures but also asserted that the vast majority of Hinayana scriptures are also composed much later than the life of Gautama Buddha, the position which was later supported by modern scriptural studies. His work represents an early and indigenous example of Buddhist studies and reflects awareness of Manichaeism and its possible relationship with Buddhism. While Michael Pye has argued that Tominaga represents a non-European example of religious studies, this view has been challenged by Jason Josephson, who argues that Tominaga does not treat non-Buddhist traditions as systematic religions. </p>',

His extensive literary output runs to over 80 works in 240 fascicles, and some of his commentaries, such as those on the <i>Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra</i> and the <i>Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana</i>, became classics revered throughout China and Japan as well as Korea. In fact, his commentary on the <i>Awakening of Faith</i> helped to make it one of the most influential and intensively studied texts in the East Asian Mahāyāna tradition. Chinese masters who were heavily influenced by Wonhyo include Fazang, Li Tongxuan, and Chengguan. The Japanese monks Gyonen, Zenshu and Joto of the Kegon school were also influenced by him.</p><p>With his life spanning the end of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and the beginning of Unified Silla, Wonhyo played a vital role in the reception and assimilation of the broad range of doctrinal Buddhist streams that flowed into the Korean peninsula at the time. Wonhyo was most interested in and affected by Buddha-nature, East Asian Yogācāra and Hwaeom thought. However, in his extensive scholarly works, composed as commentaries and essays, he embraced the whole spectrum of the Buddhist teachings which were received in Korea, including such schools as Pure Land Buddhism, East Asian Mādhyamaka and the Tiantai.

This is a commentary on his mandala-like diagram <i>haein do</i> (\'Ocean Seal\'), which consists of 210 Chinese characters that express the essence of the Huayan doctrine. A full translation can be found in the appendix to Odin, 1982.
</p><p>Little is known of his early life other than his father was named Hin-sin and his family name was Kim.
</p><p>He is famous for his travel to Táng China with his friend, Wonhyo. At one point they were captured by border guards and held for ten days as suspected spies but were subsequently released and expelled. Late, Wonhyo left Uisang, after unknowingly drinking water from a skull in the dark. The shock of this brought about an enlightenment experience such that he felt it was unnecessary to continue to China in search of wisdom.  Dismayed, but nonetheless determined, Uisang continued on his journey eventually reaching China by sea.
</p><p>A Korean folk story relates how, when he was young, Uisang fell in love with a beautiful girl, Myo Hwa ("Delicate Flower") but she was chosen by the king of Silla to be sent as a gift to the Chinese Emperor thus thwarting their relationship. This turned Uisang to the religious life and he became a monk. Myo Hwa in desperation tried to commit suicide on the journey in China by throwing herself in the river. However, she was rescued and nursed back to health by a family who subsequently adopted her. Many years later she met Uisang on his travels to China but he explained that he was now a monk and could not go back with her to Silla as she wished. However, he said he would visit her when his studies in China were complete. This he did ten years later. Unfortunately, Myo Hwa was not at home so Uisang left her a note and hurried to get his ship back to Silla. Myo Hwa returned and realized she had just missed him and ran down to the sea to try and catch him before he left. The ship however had already left the shore and in desperation she leapt in the water. As she hit the water she was magically transformed into a dragon by the strength of her love and she was able to follow the ship back to Silla. 
</p><p>Safely arrived in Silla, Uisang went on to found Buseoksa, a temple in the Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang) mountains. The temple name means "Floating Rock" and is derived from an incident in which Myo Hwa, as a dragon, scares away some bandits by magically raising a bolder into the air. She is said to have transformed herself into a  rock to continue protecting the site and her lover, Uisang.  (Story related by Sunin, 1987).
</p><p>Uisang is often referred to as the "Temple Builder" because of the number of temples he established or extended during his lifetime.

He spent the intervening periods teaching on Jaok Mountain in Gyeongju. After his death, the Oksan Seowon was erected on Jaok Mountain to venerate his memory.

He was one of the greatest thinkers of the later Joseon period, wrote highly influential books about philosophy, science and theories of government, held significant administrative positions, was a close confidant of King Jeongjo (ruled 1776-1800), and was noted as a poet. His philosophical position is often identified with the Silhak (practical learning) school, and his concerns are better seen as explorations of Neo-Confucian themes. He spent 18 years in exile in Gangjin, South Jeolla province, from 1801 until 1818, on account of his membership of the Southerners (Nam-in) faction, and also because of the Catholic faith of his elder brother. His clan originated in Naju, South Jeolla Province. At birth he was given the courtesy title (初字 choja) Gwi’nong (歸農), and later he was also known by the ja Miyong (美鏞) and Songbu (頌甫)美庸); among his ho (號, pen-names) were Saam (俟菴), Tagong (籜翁), Taesu (苔叟), Jahadoin (紫霞道人), Cheolmasanin (鐵馬山人), Dasan (茶山), Yeoyudang (與猶堂, the name of his house), and Mundo (文度, his name as a poet). Korean Catholics sometimes claim that he was baptized with the name John Baptist, but there is no documentary proof of this.

His ink paintings, especially of orchids, are equally admired.
</p><p>As a scholar, he belonged to the Silhak (Practical Learning) school also known as the Bukhak (北學, “Northern Learning”). He was related to Queen Jeongsun, the second wife of King Yeongjo, and by his adoptive mother, Nam Yang-hong, he was a cousin to Namyeon-gun Yi Gu, who was destined to be the grandfather of King Gojong (高宗, later titled 光武帝 Gwangmu Emperor. 1852–1919).

<b>Maitreyi</b> ("friendly one") was a Hindu philosopher who lived during the later Vedic period in ancient India. She is mentioned in the <i>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</i> as one of two wives of the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya; he is estimated to have lived around the 8th century BCE. In the Hindu epic <i>Mahabharata</i> and the Gṛhyasūtras, however, Maitreyi is described as an Advaita philosopher who never married.  In ancient Sanskrit literature, she is known as a <i>brahmavadini</i> (an expounder of the <i>Veda</i>).
</p><p>Maitreyi appears in ancient Indian texts, such as in a dialogue where she explores the Hindu concept of Atman (soul or self) in a dialogue with Yajnavalkya in the <i>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</i>. According to this dialogue, love is driven by a person\'s soul, and Maitreyi discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, the core of Advaita philosophy. This Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue is the topic of Sureshvara\'s <i>varttika</i>, a commentary.
</p><p>Maitreyi is cited as an example of the educational opportunities available to women in Vedic India, and their philosophical achievements. She is considered a symbol of Indian intellectual women, and an institution is named in her honour in New Delhi.

<p><b>Gargi Vachaknavi</b> (born about c. 7th century BCE) was an ancient Indian philosopher. In Vedic Literature, she is honored as a great natural philosopher, renowned expounder of the Vedas, and known as Brahmavadini, a person with knowledge of Brahma Vidya. In the Sixth and the eighth Brahmana of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, her name is prominent as she participates in the <i>brahmayajna</i>, a philosophic debate organized by King Janaka of Videha and challenges the sage Yajnavalkya with perplexing questions on the issue of <i>atman</i> (soul). She is also said to have written many hymns in the Rigveda. She remained a celibate all her life and was held in veneration by the conventional Hindus.</p><p>Gargi, the daughter of sage Vachaknu in the lineage of sage Garga (c. 800-500 BCE) was named after her father as Gargi Vachaknavi. From a young age she evinced keen interest in Vedic scriptures and became very proficient in fields of philosophy. She became highly knowledgeable in the Vedas and Upanishads in the Vedic times and held intellectual debates with other philosophers.

The couple had a son, Pericles the Younger, but the full details of the couple\'s marital status are unknown. According to Plutarch, her house became an intellectual centre in Athens, attracting the most prominent writers and thinkers, including the philosopher Socrates. It has also been suggested that the teachings of Aspasia influenced Socrates. Aspasia is mentioned in the writings of Plato, Aristophanes, Xenophon, and others.  Though she spent most of her adult life in Greece, few details of her life are fully known. Some scholars suggest that Aspasia was a brothel keeper and a prostitute. Aspasia\'s role in history provides crucial insight to the understanding of the women of ancient Greece. Very little is known about women from her time period. One scholar stated that, "To ask questions about Aspasia\'s life is to ask questions about half of humanity."</p>',

According to her hagiography, she was both a princess and a noted scholar, who became a Christian around the age of 14, converted hundreds of people to Christianity, and was martyred around the age of 18. More than 1,100 years following her martyrdom, Saint Joan of Arc identified Catherine as one of the Saints who appeared to her and counselled her.</p><p>The Eastern Orthodox Church venerates her as a Great Martyr and celebrates her feast day on 24 or 25 November (depending on the regional tradition). In Catholicism she is traditionally revered as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In 1969 the Roman Catholic Church removed her feast day from the General Roman Calendar; however, she continued to be commemorated in the Roman Martyrology on 25 November. In 2002, her feast was restored to the General Roman Calendar as an optional memorial.
</p><p>Some modern scholars consider that the legend of Catherine was probably based on the life and murder of the Greek philosopher Hypatia, with reversed roles of Christians and pagans.</p>',

<p><b>Hypatia</b> (born <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 350–370; died 415 AD) was a Hellenistic Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, then part of the Eastern Roman Empire. She was a prominent thinker of the Neoplatonic school in Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy. She is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded. Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. She is known to have written a commentary on Diophantus\'s thirteen-volume <i>Arithmetica</i>, which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus\'s original text, and another commentary on Apollonius of Perga\'s treatise on conic sections, which has not survived. Many modern scholars also believe that Hypatia may have edited the surviving text of Ptolemy\'s <i>Almagest</i>, based on the title of her father Theon\'s commentary on Book III of the <i>Almagest</i>.
</p><p>Hypatia is known to have constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. Although she herself was a pagan, she was tolerant towards Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a political feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a lector named Peter.</p><p>Hypatia\'s death shocked the empire and transformed her into a "martyr for philosophy", leading future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to become increasingly fervent in their opposition to Christianity. During the Middle Ages, Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of Christian virtue and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. During the Age of Enlightenment, she became a symbol of opposition to Catholicism. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially Charles Kingsley\'s 1853 novel <i>Hypatia</i>, romanticized her as "the last of the Hellenes". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for women\'s rights and a precursor to the feminist movement. Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia\'s death with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia\'s lifetime.</p>

Throughout her life Tullia was esteemed one of the best female writers, poets, philosophers, and charmers of her time. Influencing many of the most famous male philosophers, Tullia’s work raised the status (in literature) of women to be on an equal footing as men. Her fame and success made her into the most celebrated of Renaissance poet-courtesans. With her intellect, literary abilities and social graces, she entertained powerful men and famous poets.

</p>
<p><b>Saint Catherine of Siena</b>  (25 March 1347 – 29 April 1380), was a tertiary of the Dominican Order and a Scholastic philosopher and theologian who had a great influence on the Catholic Church. She is declared a saint and a doctor of the Church.
</p><p>Born in Siena, she grew up there and wanted very soon to devote herself to God, against the will of her parents. She joined the Sisters of the Penance of St. Dominic and made her vows. She made herself known very quickly by being marked by mystical phenomena such as stigmata and mystical marriage.</p><p>She accompanied the chaplain of the Dominicans to the pope in Avignon, as ambassador of Florence, then at war against the pope. Her influence with Pope Gregory XI played a role in his decision to leave Avignon for Rome. She was then sent by him to negotiate peace with Florence. After Gregory XI\'s death and peace concluded, she returned to Siena. She dictated to secretaries her set of spiritual treatises <i>The Dialogue of Divine Providence</i>.
</p><p>The Great Schism of the West led Catherine of Siena to go to Rome with the pope. She sent numerous letters to princes and cardinals to promote obedience to Pope Urban VI and defend what she calls the "vessel of the Church." She died on 29 April 1380, exhausted by her penances. Urban VI celebrated her funeral and burial in the Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome.
</p><p>The devotion around Catherine of Siena developed rapidly after her death. She was canonized in 1461, declared patron saint of Rome in 1866, and of Italy in 1939. First woman declared "doctor of the Church" on 4 October 1970 by Pope Paul VI with Teresa of Ávila, she was proclaimed patron saint of Europe in 1999 by Pope John Paul II. She is also the patron saint of journalists, media, and all communication professions, because of her epistolary work for the papacy.
</p><p>Catherine of Siena is one of the outstanding figures of medieval Catholicism, by the strong influence she has had in the history of the papacy. She is behind the return of the Pope from Avignon to Rome, and then carried out many missions entrusted by the pope, something quite rare for a simple nun in the Middle Ages.
</p><p>Her writings—and especially <i>The Dialogue</i>, her major work which includes a set of treatises she would have dictated during ecstasies—mark theological thought. She is one of the most influential writers in Catholicism, to the point that she is one of only four women to be declared a doctor of the Church. This recognition by the Church consecrates the importance of her writings.
</p><p>Since 18 June 1939, Catherine of Siena has been one of the two patron saints of Italy, together with Francis of Assisi. On 4 October 1970, she was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Paul VI, and on 1 October 1999, Pope John Paul II named her as one of the six patron saints of Europe, together with Benedict of Nursia, Saints Cyril and Methodius, Bridget of Sweden and Edith Stein.</p>',

<p><b>Hildegard of Bingen</b>  (German: <i lang="de">Hildegard von Bingen</i>; Latin: <i lang="la">Hildegardis Bingensis</i>; 1098 – 17 September 1179), also known as <b>Saint Hildegard</b> and <b>Sibyl of the Rhine</b>, was a German Benedictine abbess, writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath. She is considered to be the founder of scientific natural history in Germany.</p><p>Hildegard was elected <i>magistra</i> by her fellow nuns in 1136; she founded the monasteries of Rupertsberg in 1150 and Eibingen in 1165. One of her works as a composer, the <i>Ordo Virtutum</i>, is an early example of liturgical drama and arguably the oldest surviving morality play. She wrote theological, botanical, and medicinal texts, as well as letters, liturgical songs, and poems, while supervising miniature illuminations in the Rupertsberg manuscript of her first work, <i>Scivias</i>. She is also noted for the invention of a constructed language known as <i>Lingua Ignota</i>.
</p><p>Although the history of her formal consideration is complicated, she has been recognized as a saint by branches of the Roman Catholic Church for centuries. On 7 October 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named her a Doctor of the Church.

<p><b>Helena Petrovna Blavatsky</b> (Russian: <span lang="ru">Еле́на Петро́вна Блава́тская</span>, <i>Yelena Petrovna Blavatskaya</i>; 12 August [O.S. 31 July] 1831 – 8 May 1891) was a Russian occultist, philosopher, and author who co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875. She gained an international following as the leading theoretician of Theosophy, the esoteric religion that the society promoted.
</p><p>Born into an aristocratic Russian-German family in Yekaterinoslav, Ukraine, Blavatsky traveled widely around the Russian Empire as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in Western esotericism during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1849 she embarked on a series of world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India, claiming that during this period she encountered a group of spiritual adepts, the "Masters of the Ancient Wisdom", who sent her to Shigatse, Tibet, where they trained her to develop a deeper understanding of the synthesis of religion, philosophy and science. Both contemporary critics and later biographers have argued that some or all of these foreign visits were fictitious, and that she spent this period in Europe. By the early 1870s, Blavatsky was involved in the Spiritualist movement; although defending the genuine existence of Spiritualist phenomena, she argued against the mainstream Spiritualist idea that the entities contacted were the spirits of the dead. Relocating to the United States in 1873, she befriended Henry Steel Olcott and rose to public attention as a spirit medium, attention that included public accusations of fraudulence.
</p><p>In New York City, Blavatsky co-founded the Theosophical Society with Olcott and William Quan Judge in 1875. In 1877 she published <i>Isis Unveiled</i>, a book outlining her Theosophical world-view. Associating it closely with the esoteric doctrines of Hermeticism and Neoplatonism, Blavatsky described Theosophy as "the synthesis of science, religion and philosophy", proclaiming that it was reviving an "Ancient Wisdom" which underlay all the world\'s religions. In 1880 she and Olcott moved to India, where the Society was allied to the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movement. That same year, while in Ceylon she and Olcott became, supposedly, the first people from the United States to formally convert to Buddhism. Although opposed by the British administration, Theosophy spread rapidly in India but experienced internal problems after Blavatsky was accused of producing fraudulent paranormal phenomena. Amid ailing health, in 1885 she returned to Europe, there establishing the Blavatsky Lodge in London. Here she published <i>The Secret Doctrine</i>, a commentary on what she claimed were ancient Tibetan manuscripts, as well as two further books, <i>The Key to Theosophy</i> and <i>The Voice of the Silence</i>. She died of influenza.
</p><p>Blavatsky was a controversial figure during her lifetime, championed by supporters as an enlightened guru and derided as a fraudulent charlatan and plagiarist by critics. Her Theosophical doctrines influenced the spread of Hindu and Buddhist ideas in the West as well as the development of Western esoteric currents like Ariosophy, Anthroposophy, and the New Age Movement.

<p><b>Margaret Lucas Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne </b>(1623 – 15 December 1673) was an English aristocrat, philosopher, poet, scientist, fiction-writer, and playwright during the 17th century. Born <b>Margaret Lucas</b>, she was the youngest sister of prominent royalists Sir John Lucas and Sir Charles Lucas, who owned the manor of St. John\'s Abbey in Colchester. She became an attendant of Queen Henrietta Maria and traveled with her into exile in France, living for a time at the court of the young King Louis XIV. She became the second wife of William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1645, when he was a marquess.</p><p>Cavendish was a poet, philosopher, writer of prose romances, essayist, and playwright who published under her own name at a time when most women writers published anonymously. Her writing addressed a number of topics, including gender, power, manners, scientific method, and philosophy. Her utopian romance, <i>The Blazing World</i>, is one of the earliest examples of science fiction. She is singular in having published extensively in natural philosophy and early modern science. She published over a dozen original works; inclusion of her revised works brings her total number of publications to twenty-one.</p><p>Cavendish has been championed and criticized as a unique and groundbreaking woman writer. She rejected the Aristotelianism and mechanical philosophy of the seventeenth century, preferring a vitalist model instead. She was the first woman to attend a meeting at Royal Society of London in 1667 and she criticized and engaged with members and philosophers Thomas Hobbes, René Descartes, and Robert Boyle. She has been claimed as an advocate for animals and as an early opponent of animal testing.</p>

Her most recognized achievement is her translation of and commentary on Isaac Newton\'s book <i>Principia</i> containing basic laws of physics. The translation, published posthumously in 1759, is still considered the standard French translation today.  Her commentary includes a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics—the postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element.
</p><p>Her philosophical magnum opus, <i>Institutions de Physique</i> (Paris, 1740, first edition), or <i>Foundations of Physics</i>, circulated widely, generated heated debates, and was republished and translated into several other languages within two years of its original publication. She participated in the famous <i>vis viva</i> debate, concerning the best way to measure the force of a body and the best means of thinking about conservation principles. Posthumously, her ideas were heavily represented in the most famous text of the French Enlightenment, the <i>Encyclopédie</i> of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond D\'Alembert, first published shortly after Du Châtelet\'s death. Numerous biographies, books and plays have been written about her life and work in the two centuries since her death. In the early 21st century, her life and ideas have generated renewed interest.

<p><b>Catharine Trotter Cockburn</b> (16 August 1679 – 11 May 1749) was a novelist, dramatist, and philosopher. She wrote on moral philosophy,  theological tracts, and had a voluminous correspondence.
</p><p>Trotter\'s work addresses a range of issues including necessity, the infinitude of space, and the substance, but she focuses on moral issues. She thought that moral principles are not innate, but discoverable by each individual through the use of the faculty of reason endowed by God. In 1702, she published her first major philosophical work, <i>A Defence of Mr. Lock\'s [sic.] An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>.  John Locke was so pleased with this defence that he made gifts of money and books to his young apologist acting through Elizabeth Burnet who had first made Locke aware of Trotter\'s "Defence".</p><p>Her work attracted the attention of William Warburton, who prefaced her last philosophical work.  She also had a request from the biographer Thomas Birch to aid him in compiling a collection of her works.  She agreed to the project but died before the work could be printed.  Birch posthumously published a two-volume collection entitled <i>The Works of Mrs. Catharine Cockburn, Theological, Moral, Dramatic, and Poetical</i> in 1751. It is largely through this text that readers and history have come to know her.

<p><b>Mary Anne Evans</b> (22 November 1819 – 22 December 1880; alternatively "Mary Ann" or "Marian"), known by her pen name <b>George Eliot</b>, was an English novelist, poet, journalist, translator, and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. She authored seven novels, including Adam Bede (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860), Silas Marner (1861), Romola (1862-63), Middlemarch (1871–72), and Daniel Deronda (1876), most of which are set in provincial England and known for their realism  and psychological insight.</p><p>Evans used a male pen name, she said, to ensure that her works would be taken seriously. Although female authors were published under their own names during her lifetime, she wanted to escape the stereotype of women\'s writing being limited to lighthearted romances. She also wanted to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as an editor and critic. Another factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny, thus avoiding the scandal that would have arisen because of her relationship with the married George Henry Lewes.</p><p>Eliot\'s <i>Middlemarch</i> has been described by the novelists Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language.

She was a known as a nun who demonstrated the courage to challenge opinions and speak out for her beliefs.  Her outspoken opinion granted her lifelong names such as, "The Tenth Muse", "The Phoenix of America", or the "Mexican Phoenix".</p><p>Sor Juana lived during Mexico\'s colonial period, making her a contributor both to early Mexican literature as well as to the broader literature of the Spanish Golden Age.

Sister Juana educated herself in her own library, which was mostly inherited from her grandfather. After joining a nunnery in 1667, Sor Juana began writing poetry and prose dealing with such topics as love, feminism, and religion. Her criticism of misogyny and the hypocrisy of men led to her condemnation by the Bishop of Puebla, and in 1694 she was forced to sell her collection of books and focus on charity towards the poor. She died the next year, having caught the plague while treating her fellow nuns.</p>',

<p><b>Constance Caroline Woodhill Naden</b> (24 January 1858 – 23 December 1889) was an English writer, poet and philosopher. She studied, wrote and lectured on philosophy and science, alongside publishing two volumes of poetry. Several collected works were published following her death at the young age of 31. In her honour, Robert Lewins established the Constance Naden Medal and had a bust of her installed at Mason Science College (now the University of Birmingham). William Ewart Gladstone considered her one of the 19th century\'s foremost female poets.

She is canonized as a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church, and she is one of six co-patron saints of Europe.
</p><p>She was born into an observant Jewish family, but was an atheist by her teenage years. Moved by the tragedies of World War I, in 1915 she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. After completing her doctoral thesis from the University of Göttingen in 1916, she obtained an assistantship at the University of Freiburg.
</p><p>From reading the works of the reformer of the Carmelite Order, Teresa of Ávila, she was drawn to the Catholic faith. She was baptized on 1 January 1922 into the Roman Catholic Church. At that point, she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun, but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentors. She then taught at a Catholic school of education in Speyer. As a result of the requirement of an "Aryan certificate" for civil servants promulgated by the Nazi government in April 1933 as part of its Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, she had to quit her teaching position.
</p><p>She was admitted to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Cologne the following October. She received the religious habit of the Order as a novice in April 1934, taking the religious name Teresa Benedicta of the Cross. In 1938, she and her sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern sister (tertiaries of the Order, who would handle the community′s needs outside the monastery), were sent to the Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands, for their safety. Despite the Nazi invasion of that state in 1940, they remained undisturbed until they were arrested by the Nazis on 2 August 1942 and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where they died in the gas chamber on 9 August 1942.

She specialises in the history of philosophy — with particular interest in René Descartes and David Hume but she has also contributed to feminist philosophy. She studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris, where she was a student of Ferdinand Alquié, and the University of Helsinki, where she was a student of Ingmar Pörn and Georg Henrik von Wright. In the 1980s she taught at the University of Pittsburgh in the USA and in Helsinki before being named professor of philosophy at Uppsala University in 1997.</p><p>In her critically received book on Descartes (2003), Alanen goes beyond mere history, drawing out the historical antecedents and the intellectual evolution of Descartes\' thinking about the mind, showing how his emphasis on the embodiment of the mind has implications far more complex and interesting than the usual dualist account associated with his thinking suggests.
</p><p>Lilli Alanen is a member of the industrialist Ahlström family. Her mother was Finnish art collector and patron of the arts Maire Gullichsen and her father the industrialist Harry Gullichsen. Her siblings are the renowned Finnish architect Kristian Gullichsen and Johan Gullichsen, a professor of engineering. The family home at Noormarkku near Pori is the world-famous modernist house Villa Mairea designed by architect Alvar Aalto. In 1964 she married the Finnish artist Sakari Alanen (b. 1940), and they have three children. They were divorced in 1989. In 1992 Alanen married the American philosopher Frederick Stoutland (1933–2011).

<p><b>Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe</b>  (<span></span>; 18 March 1919 – 5 January 2001), usually cited as <b>G. E. M. Anscombe</b> or <b>Elizabeth Anscombe</b>, was a British analytic philosopher. She wrote on the philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, philosophical logic, philosophy of language, and ethics. She was a prominent figure of analytical Thomism.
</p><p>Anscombe was a student of Ludwig Wittgenstein and became an authority on his work and edited and translated many books drawn from his writings, above all his <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. Anscombe\'s 1958 article "Modern Moral Philosophy" introduced the term <i>consequentialism</i> into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary virtue ethics. Her monograph <i>Intention</i> is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of intention, action, and practical reasoning can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.

</p>
<p><b>Philippa Ruth Foot</b>, FBA (<span></span>; née <b>Bosanquet</b>; 3 October 1920 –  3 October 2010) was a British philosopher. She was one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics, inspired by the ethics of Aristotle. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and 1960s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize Aristotelian ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern deontological and utilitarian ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of normative ethics within analytic philosophy, especially her critique of consequentialism and of non-cognitivism. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the trolley problem. Foot\'s approach was influenced by the later work of Wittgenstein, although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him. She is the granddaughter of American President Grover Cleveland.

<p><b>Germaine Greer</b> (<span></span>; born 29 January 1939) is an Australian writer and public intellectual, regarded as one of the major voices of the second-wave feminist movement in the latter half of the 20th century. She has held academic positions at the University of Warwick, University of Tulsa and Newnham College, Cambridge, specializing in English and women\'s literature, and divides her time between Australia and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Greer\'s ideas have created controversy ever since her first book, <i>The Female Eunuch</i> (1970), made her a household name. An international bestseller and a watershed text in the feminist movement, the book offered a systematic deconstruction of ideas such as womanhood and femininity, arguing that women are forced to assume submissive roles in society to fulfill male fantasies of what being a woman entails.</p><p>Her work since then has focused on literature, feminism and the environment. She has written over 20 books, including <i>Sex and Destiny: The Politics of Human Fertility</i> (1984), <i>The Change: Women, Ageing and the Menopause</i> (1991), <i>The Whole Woman</i> (1999), <i>Shakespeare\'s Wife</i> (2007), and <i>White Beech: The Rainforest Years</i> (2013), which describes her efforts to restore an area of rainforest in the Numinbah Valley in Australia. In addition to her academic work and activism, she has been a prolific columnist for <i>The Sunday Times</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, <i>The Spectator</i>, <i>The Independent</i>, and <i>The Oldie</i>, among others.</p><p>Greer is a liberation (or radical) rather than equality feminist. Her goal is not equality with men, which she sees as assimilation and "agreeing to live the lives of unfree men". "Women\'s liberation", she wrote in <i>The Whole Woman</i> (1999), "did not see the female\'s potential in terms of the male\'s actual." She argues instead that liberation is about asserting difference and "insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination". It is a struggle for the freedom of women to "define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate".</p>',

Haraway</b> (born September 6, 1944) is a Distinguished  American Professor Emerita in the History of Consciousness Department and Feminist Studies Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, United States. She is a prominent scholar in the field of science and technology studies, described in the early 1990s as a "feminist, rather loosely a postmodernist". Haraway is the author of numerous foundational books and essays that bring together questions of science and feminism, such as "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" (1985) and "Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective" (1988). She is also a leading scholar in contemporary ecofeminism, associated with post-humanism and new materialism movements. Her work criticizes anthropocentrism, emphasizes the self-organizing powers of nonhuman processes, and explores dissonant relations between those processes and cultural practices, rethinking sources of ethics.</p><p>Haraway has taught Women\'s Studies and the History of Science at the University of Hawaii and Johns Hopkins University. Haraway\'s works have contributed to the study of both human-machine and human-animal relations. Her works have sparked debate in primatology, philosophy, and developmental biology. Haraway participated in a collaborative exchange with the feminist theorist Lynn Randolph from 1990 to 1996. Their engagement with specific ideas relating to feminism, technoscience, political consciousness, and other social issues, formed the images and narrative of Haraway\'s book <i>Modest_Witness</i> for which she received the Society for Social Studies of Science\'s (4S) Ludwik Fleck Prize in 1999. In September 2000, Haraway was awarded the Society for Social Studies of Science\'s highest honor, the J. D. Bernal Award, for her "distinguished contributions" to the field. Haraway serves on the advisory board for numerous academic journals, including <i>differences</i>, <i>Signs</i>: <i>Journal of Women in Culture and Society</i>, <i>Contemporary Women\'s Writing</i>, and <i>Environmental Humanities</i>.</p>',

Harding</b> (born 1935) is an American philosopher of feminist and postcolonial theory, epistemology, research methodology, and philosophy of science. She taught for two decades at the University of Delaware before moving to the University of California, Los Angeles in 1996.  She directed the UCLA Center for the Study of Women from 1996 to 2000, and co-edited <i>Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society</i> from 2000 to 2005.  She is currently a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education and Gender Studies at UCLA and a Distinguished Affiliate Professor of Philosophy at Michigan State University. In 2013 she was awarded the John Desmond Bernal Prize by the Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S). (Earlier recipients of this prize include Robert Merton, Thomas S. Kuhn, Mary Douglas, and Joseph Needham.)
</p><p>She has developed the research standard of “strong objectivity,” and contributed to the articulation of standpoint methodology. This kind of research process starts off from questions that arise in the daily lives of people in oppressed groups.  To answer such questions, it “studies up”, examining the principles, practices and cultures of dominant institutions, from the design and management of which oppressed groups have been excluded. She has also contributed to the development of feminist, anti-racist, multicultural, and postcolonial studies of the natural and social sciences, asking the extent to which paradigms like feminist empiricism are useful for promoting to goals of feminist inquiry.  She is the author or editor of many books and essays on these topics, and was one of the founders of the fields of feminist epistemology and philosophy of science. This work has been influential in the social sciences and in women/gender studies across the disciplines. It has helped to create new kinds of discussions about how best to relink scientific research to pro-democratic goals.
</p><p>She has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Amsterdam, the University of Costa Rica, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and the Asian Institute of Technology.  She has been a consult to several United Nations organizations including the Pan American Health Organization, UNESCO, the U.N. Commission on Science and Technology for Development, and the U.N. Development Fund for Women. Phi Beta Kappa selected her as a national lecturer in 2007.  She has lectured at over 300 colleges, universities, and conferences, on five continents.</p><p>During what is known now as the "Science Wars", she was part of a debate regarding the value-neutrality of the sciences. This aspect of her work has been criticized by the mathematicians Michael Sullivan, Mary Gray, and Lenore Blum, and by the historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz.</p><p>Harding referred to Newton\'s <i>Principia Mathematica</i> as a "rape manual" in her 1986 book "The Science Question in Feminism", a characterization that she later said she regretted.</p>',

Her scholarship incorporated a variety of structuralist and poststructuralist perspectives—including deconstruction, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and feminist theory—into a critical, interdisciplinary study of literature.  As a scholar, teacher, and translator, Johnson helped make the theories of French philosopher Jacques Derrida accessible to English-speaking audiences in the United States at a time when they had just begun to gain recognition in France. Accordingly, she is often associated with the "Yale School" of academic literary criticism.

She questions the boundaries of philosophy, while insisting upon philosophy\'s importance (for example, in "Ants and Women"). She is critical of professional philosophers\' neglectful attitude to science, and argues that disputes within sciences are often epistemological (that is, properly philosophical). In <i>Hipparchia\'s Choice</i> (1989) she questions philosophy\'s pretensions to being a unique practice which achieves a pure clarity: philosophy is inevitably shaped by language, metaphor, and power relations. According to Le Dœuff feminists make a special contribution. Their critique of gender categories in philosophy, science, and the humanities is empirical, philosophical, political, and interdisciplinary. Feminists see clearly how discourses are elevated to the status of \'philosophical\' by a process in which social power is involved.</p>',

She is a trustee of the Kennedy Memorial Trust, having been appointed by the British prime minister for a five-year term from 1 October 2014. Macpherson was president of the Scots Philosophical Association (2015-2016).</p><p>Macpherson\'s research interests include the nature of consciousness, perception, introspection, imagination and the metaphysics of mind.

She has appeared on numerous radio programmes, including on BBC Radio 4 discussing human senses and perception.</p><p>In relation to debates about the issue of all-male panels at academic conferences, Macpherson has warned against tokenism, noting that she had herself organised an all-male panel, when the prominent women she invited were unavailable. She stated that "I think that it is even all right to only invite men as speakers to some events, if that is appropriate because of research that you want to hear about and the theme of the conference".</p><p>Macpherson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2017 and a member of Academia Europaea in 2018.</p>',

<p><b>Mary Beatrice Midgley</b> (née <b>Scrutton</b>; 13 September 1919 – 10 October 2018) was a British philosopher. She was a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Newcastle University and was known for her work on science, ethics and animal rights. She wrote her first book, <i>Beast And Man</i> (1978), when she was in her fifties. She has since written over 15 other books, including <i>Animals and Why They Matter</i> (1983), <i>Wickedness</i> (1984), <i>The Ethical Primate</i> (1994), <i>Evolution as a Religion</i> (1985), and <i>Science as Salvation</i> (1992). She has been awarded honorary doctorates by Durham and Newcastle universities. Her autobiography, <i>The Owl of Minerva</i>, was published in 2005.
</p><p>Midgley strongly opposed reductionism and scientism, and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argued, wholly inadequate. She wrote extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. A number of her books and articles discussed philosophical ideas appearing in popular science, including those of Richard Dawkins. She also wrote in favour of a moral interpretation of the Gaia hypothesis. <i>The Guardian</i> described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK\'s "foremost scourge of \'scientific pretension.\'"</p>',

Hinds Professor of History of Science, Department of History, and by courtesy the d-school, Stanford University.  She received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1984. An international authority on the theory, practice, and history of gender in science, she is currently Director of Gendered Innovations in Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Environment Project. She is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Schiebinger received honorary doctorates from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium (2013), from the Faculty of Science, Lund University, Sweden (2017),  and from Universitat de València, Spain (2017). She serves on the international advisory board of <i>Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society</i>.</p><p>Over the past thirty years, Schiebinger has analyzed what she call the three “fixes”: 
"Fix the Numbers of Women" focuses on increasing the numbers of women participating in science and engineering; "Fix the Institutions" promotes gender equality in careers through structural change in research organizations; and "Fix the Knowledge" or "gendered innovations" stimulates excellence in science and technology by integrating sex and gender analysis into research. As a result of this work, she was recruited in a national search to direct Stanford University’s Clayman Institute for Gender Research, a post she held from 2004-2010.   Her job was to promote and support research on women and gender across Stanford University—from engineering, to philosophy, to medicine and business. In 2010 and 2014, she presented the keynote address and wrote the conceptual background paper for the United Nations\' Expert Group Meeting on Gender, Science, and Technology. The UN Resolutions of March 2011 call for “gender-based analysis ... in science and technology” and for the integrations of a “gender perspective in science and technology curricula.” In 2013 she presented the Gendered Innovations project at the European Parliament. Gendered Innovations was also presented to the South Korean National Assembly in 2014. In 2015, Schiebinger addressed 600 participants from 40 countries on Gendered Innovations at the Gender Summit 6—Asia Pacific, a meeting devoted to gendered innovations in research. 
</p><p>Her research interests include current issues on gender and ethnicity in STEM and also early modern Atlantic World history. She was the first women in the field of History to win the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize in 1999.
</p><p>Schiebinger’s work is highly interdisciplinary. In recognition of her creative work across academic fields of research, she was awarded the Interdisciplinary Leadership Award in the Stanford Medical School in 2010, the Linda Pollin Women’s Heart Health Leadership Award from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in 2015, the Impact of Gender/Sex on Innovation and Novel Technologies Pioneer Award in 2016, and the American Medical Women\'s Association President’s Recognition Award in 2017.</p>',

She initially attended Cornell University as a graduate student, studying cognitive and perceptual psychology with Elizabeth Spelke.  She transferred a year later to the University of Pennsylvania to study philosophy under the direction of Gary Hatfield. She received her Ph.D. in philosophy from Penn in 1994 and took her first academic job as Assistant Professor at Harvard University.  She was promoted to John L. Loeb Associate Professor of Philosophy in 1999. In 2002, she became the first woman to be tenured from a junior faculty position within Harvard’s philosophy department.  (Gisela Striker is the first woman to have a tenured position in the department, in 1989.)  In 2008 Simmons was named the Samuel H. Wolcott Professor of Philosophy, and in 2011 she was named a Harvard College Professor.
</p><p>As a graduate student, Simmons held fellowships from the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  She was named a Dean’s Scholar in 1993.  At Harvard, she has been awarded a John L. Loeb Associate Professorship, the inaugural Samuel H. Wolcott Professorship, and a five-year Harvard College Professorship.  Her article, “Changing the Cartesian Mind” was selected for Philosopher’s Annual in 2001. Simmons\' work on Descartes has been particularly influential, and she additionally serves as a jury member for the million-dollar Berggruen Prize.</p>',

The couple had a son, Pericles the Younger, but the full details of the couple\'s marital status are unknown. According to Plutarch, her house became an intellectual centre in Athens, attracting the most prominent writers and thinkers, including the philosopher Socrates. It has also been suggested that the teachings of Aspasia influenced Socrates. Aspasia is mentioned in the writings of Plato, Aristophanes, Xenophon, and others.  Though she spent most of her adult life in Greece, few details of her life are fully known. Some scholars suggest that Aspasia was a brothel keeper and a prostitute. Aspasia\'s role in history provides crucial insight to the understanding of the women of ancient Greece. Very little is known about women from her time period. One scholar stated that, "To ask questions about Aspasia\'s life is to ask questions about half of humanity."</p>',

</p><p>She began her career as a playwright in the early 1780s. As political tension rose in France, Olympe de Gouges became increasingly politically engaged. She became an outspoken advocate against the slave trade in the French colonies in 1788. At the same time, she began writing political pamphlets. Today she is perhaps best known as an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her <i>Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen</i> (1791), she challenged the practice of male authority and the notion of male-female inequality. She was executed by guillotine during the Reign of Terror (1793–1794) for attacking the regime of the Revolutionary government and for her association with the Girondists.

</p><p>Héloïse is accorded an important place in French literary history and in the development of feminist representation. While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational "monument" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondence, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the <i>bildungsroman</i> and a model of the classical epistolary genre, and which influenced writers as diverse as Madame de Lafayette, Laclos, Rousseau and Dominique Aury.

</p>
<p><b>Harriet Martineau</b> (<span></span>; 12 June 1802 – 27 June 1876) was a British social theorist and Whig writer, often cited as the first female sociologist.</p><p>Martineau wrote many books and a multitude of essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and perhaps most controversially, feminine perspective; she also translated various works by Auguste Comte. She earned enough to support herself entirely by her writing, a rare feat for a woman in the Victorian era.</p><p>The young Princess Victoria enjoyed reading Martineau\'s publications. She invited Martineau to her coronation in 1838 — an event which Martineau described, in great and amusing detail, to her many readers.</p><p>Martineau said of her own approach to writing: "when one studies a society, one must focus on all its aspects, including key political, religious, and social institutions". She believed a thorough societal analysis was necessary to understand women\'s status under men.
The novelist Margaret Oliphant said "as a born lecturer and politician [Martineau] was less distinctively affected by her sex than perhaps any other, male or female, of her generation".</p>

<p><b>Damaris Cudworth, Lady Masham</b> (18 January 1659 – 20 April 1708) was an English theological writer and advocate for women\'s education who is characterized as a proto-feminist. She overcame some weakness of eyesight and lack of access to formal higher education to win high regard among eminent thinkers of her time. With an extensive correspondence, she published two works, <i>A Discourse Concerning the Love of God</i> (1696) and <i>Thoughts in reference to a Vertuous or Christian Life</i> (1705). She is particularly noted for her long, mutually-influential friendship with the philosopher John Locke.

The letter is written in a Doric Greek dialect dated to around the 3rd century BC. The letter discusses the need for a wife to be modest and virtuous, and stresses that she should obey her husband. The content has led to the suggestion that it was written pseudonymously by a man. On the other hand, the author of the letter does not suggest that a woman is naturally inferior or weak, or that she needs a man\'s rule to be virtuous.</p>',

<p><b>Adrian Margaret Smith Piper</b> (born September 20, 1948) is an American conceptual artist and philosopher. Her work addresses how and why those involved in more than one discipline may experience professional ostracism, otherness, racial passing, and racism by using various traditional and non-traditional media to provoke self-analysis. She uses reflection on her own career as an example. Piper has been awarded various fellowships and medals and has been described as having "profoundly influenced the language and form of Conceptual art". In 2002, she founded the Adrian Piper Research Archive (APRA) in Berlin, Germany, the focus of a foundation that was established in 2009.

<p><b>Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein</b> (<small>French: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[stal]</span>; née <b>Necker</b>; 22 April 1766 – 14 July 1817), commonly known as <b>Madame de Staël</b>, was a French woman of letters of Genevan origin whose lifetime overlapped with the events of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era. For many years she lived as an exile under the Reign of Terror and under Napoleonic persecution. Known as a witty and brilliant conversationalist, often dressed in flashy and revealing outfits, she participated actively in the political and intellectual life of her times. She was present at the first opening of the Estates General and at the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Her intellectual collaboration with Benjamin Constant between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of their time. They discovered sooner than others the tyrannical character and designs of Napoleon. In 1814 one of her contemporaries observed that "there are three great powers struggling against Napoleon for the soul of Europe: England, Russia, and Madame de Staël". Her works, both novels and travel literature, with emphasis on passion, individuality and oppositional politics made their mark on European Romanticism.

</p><p>Suchon is considered to be the first philosopher to produce a significant body of work dedicated solely to the topic of women.

She is considered the only female philosopher of her time without a male intellectual advisor or husband.</p><p>In her works, Suchon argues that women are deserving of the natural rights of liberty, learning and authority.

Active during the Counter-Reformation, she was a reformer in the Carmelite Order of her time; the movement she initiated, later joined by Saint John of the Cross, eventually led to the establishment of the Discalced Carmelites, though neither she nor John were alive when the two orders separated.
</p><p>In 1622, forty years after her death, she was canonized by Pope Gregory XV, and, on 27 September 1970, she was named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Paul VI. Her books, which include her autobiography (<i>The Life of Teresa of Jesus</i>) and her seminal work <i>The Interior Castle</i>, are an integral part of Spanish Renaissance literature as well as Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practices. She also wrote <i>Way of Perfection</i>.
</p><p>After her death, Saint Teresa was considered a candidate to become a national patron saint in Spain. A Santero image of the Immaculate Conception of El Viejo, said to have been sent with one of her brothers to Peru, was Canonically crowned by Pope John Paul II on 28 December 1989 at the Shrine of El Viejo. Pious Catholic beliefs also associate Saint Teresa with the Infant Jesus of Prague with claims of former ownership and devotion.
